# aai Records {#aai.html__aai-records}

**Note:** In EPICS versions before 3.14.12, aai records may be disabled.

## Normal Operation {#aai.html__normal-operation}

With aai records, the format converter is applied to each array element.
Between the elements, a separator is printed or expected as specified by
the `Separator` [variable](#protocol.html__sysvar) in the protocol. When
parsing input, a space as the first character of the `Separator` matches
any number of any whitespace characters.

During input, a maximum of `NELM` elements is read and `NORD` is updated
accordingly. Parsing of elements stops when the separator does not
match, conversion fails, or the end of the input is reached. A minimum
of one element must be available.

During output, the first `NORD` elements are written.

The format data type must be convertible to or from the type specified
in the `FTVL` field. The types `"INT64"` and `"UINT64"` are only
available in EPICS base version 3.16 or higher.

The variable *`x[i]`* stands for one element of the written or read
value.

DOUBLE format (e.g. `%f`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x[i]`*`=double(VAL[i])`\
    `FTVL` can be `"DOUBLE"`, `"FLOAT"`, `"INT64"`, `"UINT64"`,
    `"LONG"`, `"ULONG"`, `"SHORT"`, `"USHORT"`, `"CHAR"`, `"UCHAR"`, or
    `"ENUM"` (which is treated as `"USHORT"`).\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL[i]=FTVL(`*`x[i]`*`)`\
    `FTVL` must be `"FLOAT"` or `"DOUBLE"`

LONG or ENUM format (e.g. `%i` or `%{`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x[i]`*`=long(VAL[i])`\
    `FTVL` can be `"INT64"`, `"UINT64"`, `"LONG"`, `"ULONG"`, `"SHORT"`,
    `"USHORT"`, `"CHAR"`, `"UCHAR"`, or `"ENUM"` (which is treated as
    `"USHORT"`).\
    Signed values are sign-extended to long, unsigned values are
    zero-extended to long before converting them.\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL[i]=FTVL(`*`x[i])`*\
    `FTVL` can be `"DOUBLE"`, `"FLOAT"`, `"INT64"`, `"UINT64"`,
    `"LONG"`, `"ULONG"`, `"SHORT"`, `"USHORT"`, `"CHAR"`, `"UCHAR"`, or
    `"ENUM"` (which is treated as `"USHORT"`).\
    The value is truncated to the least significant bytes if `FTVL` has
    a smaller data size than `long`.

STRING format (e.g. `%s`):

:   

    If `FTVL=="STRING"`:
    :   [Output:]{.underline} *`x[i]`*`=VAL[i]`\
        [Input:]{.underline} `VAL[i]=`*`x[i]`*\
        Note that this is an array of strings, not an array of
        characters.

    If `FTVL=="CHAR"` or `FTVL="UCHAR"`:
    :   In this case, the complete aai is treated as a large single
        string of size `NORD`. No separators are printed or expected.\
        [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=range(VAL,0,NORD)`\
        The first `NORD` characters are printed, which might be less
        than `NELM`.\
        [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*`, NORD=length(`*`x`*`)`\
        A maximum of `NELM-1` characters can be read. `NORD` is updated
        to the index of the first of the trailing zeros. Usually, this
        is the same as the string length.

    Other values of `FTVL` are not allowed for this format.

## Initialization {#aai.html__initialization}

During [initialization](#processing.html__init), the `@init` handler is
executed, if present. All format converters work like in normal
operation.

# ai Records {#ai.html__ai-records}

## Normal Operation {#ai.html__normal-operation}

Depending on the format type, different record fields are used for
output and input. The variable *`x`* stands for the written or read
value.

DOUBLE format (e.g. `%f`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=(VAL-AOFF)/ASLO`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=(`*`x`*`*ASLO+AOFF)*(1.0-SMOO)+VAL*SMOO`\
    In both cases, if `ASLO==0.0`, it is treated as `1.0`. Default
    values are `ASLO=1.0`, `AOFF=0.0`, `SMOO=0.0`.\
    If input is successful, `UDF` is cleared.

LONG format (e.g. `%i`):

:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=RVAL`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `RVAL=`*`x`*\
    Note that the record calculates
    `VAL=(((RVAL+ROFF)*ASLO+AOFF)*ESLO+EOFF)*(1.0-SMOO)+VAL*SMOO` if
    `LINR=="LINEAR"`. `ESLO` and `EOFF` might be set in the record
    definition. *StreamDevice* does not set it. For example, `EOFF=-10`
    and `ESLO=0.000305180437934` (=20.0/0xFFFF) maps 0x0000 to -10.0,
    0x7FFF to 0.0 and 0xFFFF to 10.0. Using unsigned formats with values
    â‰¥ 0x800000 gives different results on 64 bit machines.

    If `LINR=="NO CONVERSION"` (the default), `VAL` is directly
    converted from and to `long` without going through `RVAL`. This
    allows for more bits on 64 bit machines. To get the old behavior,
    use `LINR=="LINEAR"`.

ENUM format (e.g. `%{`):
:   Not allowed.

STRING format (e.g. `%s`):
:   Not allowed.

## Initialization {#ai.html__initialization}

During [initialization](#processing.html__init), the `@init` handler is
executed, if present. In contrast to normal operation, in DOUBLE input
`SMOO` is ignored (treated as `0.0`).

    values are `ASLO=1.0`, `AOFF=0.0`.\
    Note that `OVAL` is not necessarily equal to `VAL` if `OROC!=0.0`.

LONG format (e.g. `%i`):

:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=RVAL`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `RBV=RVAL=`*`x`*\
    Note that the record calculates
    `RVAL=(((OVAL-EOFF)/ESLO)-AOFF)/ASLO` if `LINR=="LINEAR"`. `ESLO`
    and `EOFF` might be set in the record definition. *StreamDevice*
    does not set it. For example, `EOFF=-10` and
    `ESLO=0.000305180437934` (=20.0/0xFFFF) maps -10.0 to 0x0000, 0.0 to

# Bus API {#businterface.html__bus-api}

[]{#businterface.html__class}

## Bus Interface Class {#businterface.html__bus-interface-class}

*StreamDevice* already comes with an interface to
[*asynDriver*](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/){target="ex"}.
You should first try to implement your bus driver compatible to
*asynOctet*. Then it can be used by *StreamDevice* automatically. Only
if that does not work, write your own bus interface.

A bus interface is a C++ class that inherits from *StreamBusInterface*.
Its purpose is to provide an interface to *StreamDevice* for a low-level
I/O bus driver. *StreamDevice* acts as a client of the interface,
calling interface methods and receiving replies via callbacks. Since the
internal details of *StreamDevice* are not of interest to a bus
interface, I will reference it simply as *client* in this chapter. The
interface class must be registered via a call to
` `[`RegisterStreamBusInterface`](#businterface.html__registration)`()`
in the global context of the C++ file (not in a header file).

Interface methods called by the client must not block for arbitrary long
times. That means the interface is allowed to take mutex semaphores to
protect its internal data structures but it must not take event
semaphores to wait for external I/O or similar.

It is assumed that the interface creates a separate thread to handle
blocking I/O and to call the callback methods in the context of that
thread when I/O has completed or timed out. The callback methods don\'t
block but may in turn call interface methods. Much of the actual work
will be done in the context of those callbacks, i.e. in the interface
thread, thus be generous with stack.

### Example bus interface class declaration {#businterface.html__example-bus-interface-class-declaration}

    #include <StreamBusInterface.h>

    class MyInterface : StreamBusInterface
    {
        // ... (internally used attributes and methods)

        MyInterface(Client* client);
        ~MyInterface();

        // StreamBusInterface virtual methods
        bool lockRequest(unsigned long lockTimeout_ms);
        bool unlock();
        bool writeRequest(const void* output, size_t size, unsigned long writeTimeout_ms);
        bool readRequest(unsigned long replyTimeout_ms, unsigned long readTimeout_ms, ssize_t expectedLength, bool async);
        bool supportsAsyncRead();
        bool supportsEvent();
        bool acceptEvent(unsigned long mask, unsigned long timeout_ms);
        bool connectRequest(unsigned long timeout_ms);
        bool disconnectRequest();
        void finish();

    public:
        // creator method
        static StreamBusInterface* getBusInterface(
            Client* client, const char* busname,
            int addr, const char* param);
    };

    RegisterStreamBusInterface(MyInterface);

    // ... (implementation)

### Methods to implement {#businterface.html__methods-to-implement}

The interface class must implement a public static creator method:

::: indent
` static StreamBusInterface* `[`getBusInterface`](#businterface.html__create)`(Client*Â client, constÂ char*Â busname, intÂ addr, constÂ char*Â param); `
:::

And it must implement the following pure virtual methods:

::: indent
` bool `[`lockRequest`](#businterface.html__lock)`(unsignedÂ longÂ lockTimeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` bool `[`unlock`](#businterface.html__lock)`(); `
:::

It may implement additional virtual methods if the bus supports it:

::: indent
` bool `[`writeRequest`](#businterface.html__write)`(constÂ void*Â output, size_tÂ size, unsignedÂ longÂ writeTimeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` bool `[`readRequest`](#businterface.html__read)`(unsignedÂ longÂ replyTimeout_ms, unsignedÂ longÂ readTimeout_ms, ssize_tÂ expectedLength, boolÂ async); `
:::

::: indent
` bool `[`supportsAsyncRead`](#businterface.html__read)`(); `
:::

::: indent
` bool `[`supportsEvent`](#businterface.html__event)`(); `
:::

::: indent
` bool `[`acceptEvent`](#businterface.html__event)`(unsignedÂ longÂ mask, unsignedÂ longÂ timeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` bool `[`connectRequest`](#businterface.html__connect)`(unsignedÂ longÂ timeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` bool `[`disconnectRequest`](#businterface.html__connect)`(); `
:::

::: indent
` void `[`finish`](#businterface.html__lock)`(); `
:::

It also may override the following virtual method:

::: indent
` void `[`release`](#businterface.html__create)`(); `
:::

### Callback methods provided {#businterface.html__callback-methods-provided}

The base class *StreamBusInterface* implements a set of protected
callback methods which must be called in response to the above request
methods (most probably from another thread):

::: indent
` void `[`lockCallback`](#businterface.html__lock)`(StreamIoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

::: indent
` void `[`writeCallback`](#businterface.html__write)`(StreamIoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

::: indent
` ssize_t `[`readCallback`](#businterface.html__read)`(StreamIoStatusÂ status, constÂ void*Â bufferÂ =Â NULL, size_tÂ sizeÂ =Â 0); `
:::

::: indent
` void `[`eventCallback`](#businterface.html__event)`(StreamIoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

::: indent
` void `[`connectCallback`](#businterface.html__connect)`(StreamIoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

::: indent
` void `[`disconnectCallback`](#businterface.html__connect)`(StreamIoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

### Other provided methods, attibutes, and types {#businterface.html__other-provided-methods-attibutes-and-types}

During startup, each client instance searches for its bus interface by
name. It does so by calling the static `getBusInterface()` method of
every registered interface class. This method should check by `busname`
if its interface class is responsible for that bus. If yes, it should
check if the address `addr` is valid and associate a *device* with
`busname`/`addr`. Some busses do not have addresses and allow only one
device (e.g. RS232). Interfaces to such busses can ignore `addr`. The
bus interface may then try to connect to the device, but it should allow
it to be disconnected or switched off at that time. If the bus interface
requires additional parameters, parse the `param` string. Your
constructor should pass `client` to the base class constructor
`StreamBusInterface(Client* client)`.

On success, `getBusInterface` should then return a pointer to a bus
interface instance. Note that many client instances may want to connect
to the same device. Each needs its own bus interface instance. The bus
interface can get a string containing the name of the client instance
from `clientName()`. This name is for use in error and log messages.

On failure, or if this interface class is not responsible for that bus,
`getBusInterface` should return `NULL`. The client will then try other
bus interface classes.

When the client does not need the interface any more, it calls
`release()`. The default implementation of `release()` assumes that
`getBusInterface()` has allocated a new bus interface and just calls
`delete`. You should change `release()` if that assumption is not
correct.

### Connecting and disconnecting {#businterface.html__connecting-and-disconnecting}

::: indent
` bool connectRequest(unsignedÂ longÂ timeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` bool disconnectRequest(); `
:::

::: indent
` void connectCallback(IoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

::: indent
` void disconnectCallback(IoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

Whenever possible connection should be handled automatically. The
interface should call `connectCallback()` when the device has connected
and `disconnectCallback()` when the device has disconnected. These
callbacks can be called asynchronously at any time.

If the device is disconnected, an attempt to access the device should
try to reconnect. Normally, the interface should not try to disconnect
unless the device does so automatically.

However, sometimes the client wants to connect or disconnect explicitly.
To connect, the client calls `connectRequest()`. This function should
set up things to reconnect but should not block waiting. Instead it
should immediately return `true` if it expects that connection can be
established soon, or `false` if the request cannot be accepted or
connection handling is not supported. The interface should call
`connectCallback()` once the bus could be connected. If the device can
connect immediately without waiting, it may also call
`connectCallback()` directly from `connectRequest()`.

If the bus cannot be connected within `timeout_ms` milliseconds, the bus
interface should call `connectCallback(StreamIoTimeout)`.

If a device cannot be connected, for example because there is something
wrong with the I/O hardware, `connectCallback(StreamIoFault)` may be
called.

To disconnect explicitly, the client calls `disconnectRequest()`; This
function should return `true` immediately or `false` if the request
cannot be accepted or connection handling is not supported. The
interface should call `connectCallback()` once the bus is disconnected.
There is no timeout for this operation. If disconnecting is impossible,
the interface should call `connectCallback(StreamIoFault)`.

[]{#businterface.html__lock}

### Bus locking {#businterface.html__bus-locking}

::: indent
` bool lockRequest(unsignedÂ longÂ timeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` void lockCallback(IoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

::: indent
` bool unlock(); `
:::

::: indent
` long priority(); `
:::

::: indent
` void finish(); `
:::

Before doing output, the client calls `lockRequest()` to get exclusive
access to the device. This function should return `true` immediately or
`false` if the request cannot be accepted. If the device is already
locked, the bus interface should add itself to a queue, sorted by
`priority()`. As soon as the device is available, the bus interface
should call `lockCallback()`. If the bus cannot be locked within
`lockTimeout_ms` milliseconds, the bus interface should call
`lockCallback(StreamIoTimeout)`.

If a device cannot be locked, for example because there is something
wrong with the I/O hardware, `lockCallback(StreamIoFault)` may be
called.

Normally, it is not necessary to lock the complete bus but only one
device (i.e. one address). Other clients should still be able to talk to
other devices on the same bus.

The client may perform several read and write operations when it has
locked the device. When the protocol ends and the device is locked, the
client calls `unlock()`. If other bus interfaces are in the lock queue,
the next one should call `lockCallback()` now.

The client calls `finish()` when the protocol ends. This allows the bus
interface to clean up. The bus interface should also cancel any
outstanding requests of this client.

[]{#businterface.html__write}

### Writing output {#businterface.html__writing-output}

::: indent
` bool writeRequest(constÂ void*Â output, size_tÂ size, unsignedÂ longÂ writeTimeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` void writeCallback(IoStatusÂ status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

::: indent
` constÂ char*Â getOutTerminator(size_t&Â length); `
:::

To start output, the client calls `writeRequest()`. You can safely
assume that the device has already been locked at this time. That means,
no other client will call `writeRequest()` for this device and no other
output is currently active for this device until it has been unlocked.

The function should arrange transmission of `size` bytes of `output` but
return `true` immediately or `false` if the request cannot be accepted.
It must not block until output has completed. After all output has been
successfully transmitted, but not earlier, the interface should call
`writeCallback()`.

If output blocks for `writeTimeout_ms` milliseconds, the interface
should abort the transmision and call `writeCallback(StreamIoTimeout)`.

If output is impossible, for example because there is something wrong
with the I/O hardware, `writeCallback(StreamIoFault)` may be called.

The interface must send excactly the `size` bytes from `output`, not
less. It should not change anything unless the bus needs some special
formatting (e.g. added header, escaped bytes) and it should not assume
that any bytes have a special meaning. In particular, a null byte does
not terminate `output`.

A call to `getOutTerminator()` tells the interface which terminator has
already been added to the output. If `NULL` was returned, the client is
not aware of a terminator (no outTerminator was defined in the
protocol). In this case, the interface may add a terminator which it
knows from other sources. An interface is not required to support `NULL`
results and may not add any terminator in this case.

The buffer referenced by `output` stays valid until `writeCallback()` is
called.

The client may request more I/O or call `unlock()` after
`writeCallback()` has been called.

[]{#businterface.html__read}

### Reading input {#businterface.html__reading-input}

::: indent
` bool readRequest(unsignedÂ longÂ replyTimeout_ms, unsignedÂ longÂ readTimeout_ms, ssize_tÂ expectedLength, boolÂ async); `
:::

::: indent
` ssize_t readCallback(IoStatusÂ status, constÂ void*Â bufferÂ =Â NULL, size_tÂ sizeÂ =Â 0); `
:::

::: indent
` constÂ char*Â getInTerminator(size_t&Â length); `
:::

::: indent
` bool supportsAsyncRead(); `
:::

The client calls `readRequest()` to tell the bus interface that it
expects input. Depending on the bus, this function might have to set the
bus hardware into receive mode. If `expectedLength>0`, the the bus
interface should stop input after this number of bytes have been
received. In opposite to writing, the device may be in a non-locked
status when `readRequest()` is called.

This function must not block until input is available. Instead, it
should arrange for `readCallback(StreamIoSuccess, buffer, size)` to be
called when input has been received and return `true` immediately or
`false` if the request cannot be accepted.

Here, `buffer` is a pointer to `size` input bytes. The bus interface is
responsible for the buffer. The client copies its contents. It does not
modify or free it.

It is not necessary to wait until all data has been received. The bus
interface can call `n=readCallback()` after any amount of input has been
received. If the client expects more input, `readCallback()` returns a
non-zero value. A positive `n` means, the client expects another `n`
bytes of input. A negative `n` means, the client expects an unspecified
amount of additional input.

With some bus interfaces, `readRequest()` might not have to do anything
because the bus is always receiving. It might also be that the bus has
no local buffer associated to store input before it is fetched with some
`read()` call. In this case, a race condition between device and client
can occure. To avoid loss of data,
`readCallback(StreamIoSuccess, buffer, size)` may be called in this case
even before `readRequest()`. If the client is expecting input in the
next future, it will store it. Otherwise the input is dropped.

The `replyTimeout_ms` parameter defines how many milliseconds to wait
for the first byte of a reply before the device is considered offline.
If no input has been received after `replyTimeout_ms` milliseconds, the
bus interface should call `readCallback(StreamIoNoReply)`.

The `readTimeout_ms` parameter is the maximum time to wait for further
input. If input stops for longer than `readTimeout_ms` milliseconds the
bus interface should call `readCallback(StreamIoTimeout,buffer,size)`.
The client decides if this timeout is an error or a legal termination.
Thus, pass all input received so far.

A call to `getInTerminator(length)` tells the interface which terminator
is expected for input and `length` is set to the number of bytes of the
terminator. The result is a hint to the bus interface to recognize the
end of an input. Once the terminator string is found, the bus interface
should stop receiving input and call
`readCallback(StreamIoSuccess, buffer, size)`. It is not necessary to
remove the terminator string from the received input. An empty
terminator string (`length==0`) means: Don\'t look for terminators.

If `NULL` was returned, the client is not aware of a terminator (no
inTerminator was defined in the protocol). In this case, the interface
may look for a terminator which it knows from other sources, reduce size
by the terminator length and call
`readCallback(StreamIoEnd, buffer, size)`. A bus interface is not
required to support `NULL` results and may treat them as empty
terminator (see above).

Some busses (e.g. GPIB) support special \"end of message\" signals. If
such a signal is received, the bus interface should call
`readCallback(StreamIoEnd, buffer, size)`. Use it to indicate a special
\"end of message\" signal which is not visible in the normal byte data
stream. If `getInTerminator()` has not returned `NULL` it it not
necessary to remove a terminator which may come in addition to the \"end
of message\" signal.

If input is impossible, for example because there is something wrong
with the I/O hardware, `readCallback(StreamIoFault)` may be called.

Sometimes a client wishes to get any input received at any time, even
when requested by another client. If a client wishes to receive such
asynchronous input, it first calls `supportsAsyncRead()`. The default
implementation of this method always returns `false`. If a bus interface
supports asynchronous input, it should overwrite this method to set up
everything needed to receive asynchronous input and then return `true`.
The client is then allowed to call `readRequest()` with the
`async==true`. This means that the client is now interested in
asynchronous input. It should receive a `readCallback()` of all input
which came in response to any synchonous (`async==false`) request from
another client (which should receive the input, too). The interface
should also receive asynchronous input when no synchonous client is
active at the moment. Many asynchronous `readRequest()` calls from
different clients may be active at the same time. All of them should
receive the same input.

For asynchronous requests, `replyTimeout_ms` has a different meaning: If
the bus interface has to poll the bus for input, it may take
`replyTimeout_ms` as a hint for the poll period. If many asynchronous
requests are active at the same time, it should poll with the shortest
period of all clients. An asynchronous request does not time out. It
stays active until the next input arrives. The client may reissue the
asynchronous `readRequest()` from within the `readCallback()` if it
wants to continue receiving asynchronous input.

If the client calls `finish()` at any time, the bus interface should
cancel all outstanding requests, including asynchronous read requests.

[]{#businterface.html__event}

### Handling events {#businterface.html__handling-events}

::: indent
` bool supportsEvent(); `
:::

::: indent
` bool acceptEvent(unsigned long mask, unsigned long timeout_ms); `
:::

::: indent
` void eventCallback(StreamIoStatus status = StreamIoSuccess); `
:::

An event is a sort of input from a device which is not part of the
normal byte stream. One example is the SRQ line of GPIB. Not all bus
types have events. To support events, the bus interface must overwrite
`supportsEvent()` to return `true`. The default implementation always
returns `false`.

If `true` is returned, the client is allowed to call `acceptEvent()`,
where `mask` defines the (bus dependent) type of event or events to wait
for. If `mask` is illegal, `acceptEvent()` should return `false`. The
call to `acceptEvent()` must not block. It should arrange to call
`eventCallback()` when the event matching `mask` arrives within
`timeout_ms` milliseconds. If no such event arrives within this time,
the bus interface should call `eventCallback(StreamIoTimeout)`.

To avoid race conditions, the bus interface should buffer events and
also report a matching event which occured before the actual call to
`acceptEvent()` but after any previous call of any other request method
like `writeRequest()`.

# calcout Records {#calcout.html__calcout-records}

**Note:** Device support for calcout records is only available for EPICS
base R3.14.5 or higher.

## Normal Operation {#calcout.html__normal-operation}

Different record fields are used for output and input. The variable
*`x`* stands for the written or read value.

DOUBLE format (e.g. `%f`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=OVAL`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*\
    Note that the record calculates `OVAL` from `CALC` or `OCAL`
    depending on `DOPT`.

LONG format (e.g. `%i`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=int(OVAL)`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*\

ENUM format (e.g. `%{`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=int(OVAL)`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*\

STRING format (e.g. `%s`):
:   Not allowed.

For calcout records, it is probably more useful to access fields `A` to
`L` directly (e.g. `"%(A)f"`). However, even if `OVAL` is not used, it
is calculated by the record. Thus, `CALC` must always contain a valid
expression (e.g. `"0"`).

## Initialization {#calcout.html__initialization}

During [initialization](#processing.html__init), the `@init` handler is
executed, if present. All format converters work like in normal
operation.

# Using EPICS 3.13 {#epics3_13.html__using-epics-3.13}

[]{#epics3_13.html__pre}

## 1. Prerequisites {#epics3_13.html__prerequisites}

*StreamDevice* version 2.2 and higher can run on EPICS 3.13. However,
this requires some preparation, because EPICS 3.13 is missing some
libraries and header files. Also *asynDriver* needs to be modified to
compile with EPICS 3.13. Due to the limitations of EPICS 3.13, you can
build streamDevice only for vxWorks systems.

Of course, you need an installation of [EPICS
3.13](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-13.php){target="ex"}. I guess
you already have that, otherwhise you would want to [install
*StreamDevice* on EPICS 3.14](setup). I have tested *StreamDevice* with
EPICS versions 3.13.7 up to 3.13.10 with vxWorks 5.3.1 and 5.5 on a
ppc604 processor.

Download my [compatibility
package](http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/compat-1-0.tgz),
[*asynDriver*](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/){target="ex"}
version 4-3 or higher, and my [configure
patches](http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/configure.tgz).

[]{#epics3_13.html__compat}

## 2. Build the Compatibility Package {#epics3_13.html__build-the-compatibility-package}

Unpack [compat-1-0.tgz]{.kbd} in the [\<top\>]{.kbd} directory of your
application build area. (Please refer to the [*EPICS IOC Software
Configuration
Management*](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/EpicsDocumentation/AppDevManuals/iocScm-3.13.2/managingATop.html#3){target="ex"}
document.)

Change to the [compat]{.kbd} directory and run [make]{.kbd}. This
installs many EPICS 3.14-style header files and a small library
([compatLib]{.kbd}).

[]{#epics3_13.html__asyn}

## 3. Build the *asynDriver* Library {#epics3_13.html__build-the-asyndriver-library}

Unpack the *asynDriver* package and change to its top directory.

Unpack [configure.tgz]{.kbd} here. This will modify files in the
[configure]{.kbd} directory. Change to the [configure]{.kbd} directory
and edit [CONFIG_APP]{.kbd}. Set `COMPAT=...` to the [\<top\>]{.kbd}
directory where you have installed the compatibility package before.
(This patch might also allow you to compile other 3.14-style drivers for
3.13. It has absolutely no effect if you use EPICS 3.14.)

Edit [RELEASE]{.kbd} and comment out `IPAC=...` (unless you have the
*ipac* package and somehow made it compatible to EPICS 3.13). Set
`EPICS_BASE` to your EPICS 3.13 installation.

Run [make]{.kbd} in the [configure]{.kbd} directory.

Change to [../asyn/devGpib]{.kbd} and edit [devGpib.h]{.kbd} and
[devSupportGpib.c]{.kbd}. Change all occurrences of `staticÂ gDset` to
`gDset`.

Go one directory up (to [asyn]{.kbd}) and run [make]{.kbd} twice! (The
first run will just create [Makefile.Vx]{.kbd}.) Ignore all compiler
warnings.

Do not try to build the test applications. It will not work.

[]{#epics3_13.html__lib}

## 4. Build the *StreamDevice* Library {#epics3_13.html__build-the-streamdevice-library}

Go to the [\<top\>]{.kbd} directory of your application build area.

Edit [config/RELEASE]{.kbd} and add the variable `ASYN`. Set it to the
location of the *asynDriver* installation. Also set the `COMPAT`
variable to the location of the compatibility package. Run [make]{.kbd}
in the [config]{.kbd} directory.

Unpack the *StreamDevice* package in your [\<top\>]{.kbd} directory.
Change to the newly created *StreamDevice* directory and run
[make]{.kbd}.

[]{#epics3_13.html__app}

## 5. Build an Application {#epics3_13.html__build-an-application}

To use *StreamDevice*, your application must be built with the *asyn*,
*stream*, and *compat* libraries and must load [asyn.dbd]{.kbd} and
[stream.dbd]{.kbd}. Also, as the *stream* library contains C++ code, the
application must be munched. Therefore, include
[\$(TOP)/config/RULES.munch]{.kbd}. (Put your application in the same
[\<top\>]{.kbd} as the *StreamDevice* installation.)

Include the following lines in your [Makefile.Vx]{.kbd}:

    LDLIBS += $(COMPAT_BIN)/compatLib
    LDLIBS += $(ASYN_BIN)/asynLib
    LDLIBS += $(INSTALL_BIN)/streamLib

    include $(TOP)/config/RULES.munch

Include the following lines in your [xxxAppInclude.dbd]{.kbd} file to
use *stream* and *asyn* (you also need a [base.dbd]{.kbd}):

    include "base.dbd"
    include "stream.dbd"
    include "asyn.dbd"

You can find an example application in the [streamApp]{.kbd}
subdirectory.

[]{#epics3_13.html__sta}

## 6. The Startup Script {#epics3_13.html__the-startup-script}

*StreamDevice* is based on [*protocol files*](#protocol.html). To tell
*StreamDevice* where to search for protocol files, set the environment
variable `STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH` to a list of directories to search.
Directories are separated by `:`. The default value is
`STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=.`, i.e. the current directory.

Also configure the buses (in *asynDriver* terms: ports) you want to use
with *StreamDevice*. You can give the buses any name you want, like
[COM1]{.kbd} or [socket]{.kbd}, but I recommend to use names related to
the connected device.

### Example: {#epics3_13.html__example}

A power supply with serial communication (9600 baud, 8N1) is connected
to [/dev/ttyS1]{.kbd}. The name of the power supply is `PS1`. Protocol
files are either in the current working directory or in the
[../protocols]{.kbd} directory.

Then the startup script must contain lines like this:

    ld < iocCore
    ld < streamApp.munch
    dbLoadDatabase ("streamApp.dbd")

    putenv ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=.:../protocols")

    drvAsynSerialPortConfigure ("PS1","/dev/ttyS1")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "baud", "9600")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "bits", "8")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "parity", "none")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "stop", "1")

An alternative approach is to skip step 5 (do not build an application)
and load all components explicitely in the startup script. The
`STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH` variable can also be a vxWorks shell variable.

    ld < iocCore
    ld < compatLib
    ld < asynLib
    ld < streamLib.munch
    dbLoadDatabase ("asyn.dbd")
    dbLoadDatabase ("stream.dbd")

    STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=".:../protocols"

    drvAsynSerialPortConfigure ("PS1","/dev/ttyS1")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "baud", "9600")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "bits", "8")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "parity", "none")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "stop", "1")

# Format Converter API {#formatconverter.html__format-converter-api}

[]{#formatconverter.html__class}

## Converter Class {#formatconverter.html__converter-class}

A user defined converter class inherits public from
*StreamFormatConverter* and handles one or more conversion characters.
It is not necessary that a given conversion character supports both,
printing and scanning. But if it does, both must be handled by the same
converter class.

Any conversion corresponds to one data type. The converter class must
implement print and/or scan methods for this data type. It must also
implement a parse method to analyse the format string.

A converter class must be registered with a call to RegisterConverter()
in the global file context.

The converter must not contain any class variables, because there will
be only one global instance for each conversion character - not one for
each format string!

### Example: LONG converter for `%Q` {#formatconverter.html__example-long-converter-for-q}

    #include "StreamFormatConverter.h"

    class MyConverter : public StreamFormatConverter
    {
        int parse(const StreamFormat&, StreamBuffer&, const char*&, bool);
        bool printLong(const StreamFormat&, StreamBuffer&, long);
        ssize_t scanLong(const StreamFormat&, const char*, long&);
    };

    RegisterConverter(MyConverter,"Q");

    // ... (implementation)

[]{#formatconverter.html__theory}

## Theory of Operation {#formatconverter.html__theory-of-operation}

[]{#formatconverter.html__registration}

### Registration {#formatconverter.html__registration}

::: indent
` RegisterConverter(`*`converterClass`*`, "`*`characters`*`"); `
:::

This macro registers the converter class for all given conversion
characters. In most cases, you will give only one character. The macro
must be called once for each class in the global file context.

HINT: Do not branch depending on the conversion character. Provide
multiple classes, that\'s more efficient.

[]{#formatconverter.html__parsing}

### Parsing {#formatconverter.html__parsing}

::: indent
` int parse(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, StreamBuffer&Â info, constÂ char*&Â source, boolÂ scanFormat); `
:::

::: indent
` structÂ StreamFormat { charÂ conv; StreamFormatTypeÂ type; unsignedÂ shortÂ flags; longÂ prec; unsignedÂ longÂ width; unsignedÂ longÂ infolen; constÂ char*Â info; }; `
:::

During initialization, `parse()` is called whenever one of the
conversion characters handled by your converter class is found in a
protocol. The fields `fmt.conv`, `fmt.flags`, `fmt.prec`, and
`fmt.width` have already been filled in. If a scan format is parsed,
`scanFormat` is `true`. If a print format is parsed, `scanFormat` is
`false`.

The `fmt.flags` field is a bitset and can have any of the following
flags set:

-   `left_flag`: the format contained a `-`. This is normaly used to
    indicate that the value should be printed left-aligned.
-   `sign_flag`: the format contained a `+`. This normaly requests to
    print a sign even for positive numbers.
-   `space_flag`: the format contained a \'`Â `\' (space). This normaly
    requests to print a space instead of a sign for positive numbers.
-   `alt_flag`: the format contained a `#`. This indicated the request
    to use an alternative format. For example in `%#x` the hex number is
    preficed with `0x`.
-   `zero_flag`: the format contained a `0`. This normaly requests to
    pad a numerical value with leading zeros instead of leading spaces.
-   `skip_flag`: the format contained a `*`. The value is parsed and
    checked but then discarded.

It is not necessary that these flags have exactly the same meaning in
your formats, but a similar and intuitive meaning is helpful for the
user.

There are two additional flags, `default_flag` indicating a `?` and
`compare_flag` indicating a `=` in the format, that are handled
internally by *StreamDevice* and are not of interest to the converter
class.

The `source` pointer points to the character of the format string just
after the conversion character. You can parse additional characters if
they belong to the format string handled by your class. Move the
`source` pointer so that is points to the first character after your
format string. This is done for example in the builtin formats
`%[charset]` or `%{enum0|enum1}`. However, many formats don\'t need
additional characters.

#### Example {#formatconverter.html__example}

     source       source
     before       after
     parse()      parse()
         |         |
    "%39[0-9a-zA-Z]constant text"
        |
     conversion
     character

You can write any data you may need later in `print*()` or `scan*()` to
the [*Streambuffer*](streambuffer.html) `info`. This will probably be
necessary if you have parsed additional characters from the format
string as in the above example\

Return `unsigned_format`, `signed_format`, `double_format`,
`string_format`, or `enum_format` depending on the datatype associated
with the conversion character. It is not necessary to return the same
value for print and for scan formats. You can even return different
values depending on the format string.

If the format is not a real data conversion but does other things with
the data (append or check a checksum, encode or decode the data,\...),
return `pseudo_format`.

Return `false` if there is any parse error or if print or scan is
requested but not supported by this conversion or flags are used that
are not supported by this conversion.

[]{#formatconverter.html__printing_scanning}

### Printing and Scanning {#formatconverter.html__printing-and-scanning}

Provide a `print[Long|Double|String|Pseudo]()` and/or
`scan[Long|Double|String|Pseudo]()` method appropriate for the data type
you have returned in the `parse()` method. That method is called
whenever the conversion appears in an output or input, respectively. You
only need to implement the flavour of print and/or scan suitable for the
datatype returned by `parse()`. Both `unsigned_format` and
`signed_format` will use the `Long` flavour.

The possible interface methods are:

::: indent
` bool printLong(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, StreamBuffer& output, long value); `
:::

::: indent
` bool printDouble(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, StreamBuffer& output, double value); `
:::

::: indent
` bool printString(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, StreamBuffer& output, constÂ char* value); `
:::

::: indent
` bool printPseudo(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, StreamBuffer& output); `
:::

::: indent
` ssize_t scanLong(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, constÂ char* input, long& value); `
:::

::: indent
` ssize_t scanDouble(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, constÂ char* input, double& value); `
:::

::: indent
` ssize_t scanString(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, constÂ char* input, char* value, size_t& size); `
:::

::: indent
` ssize_t scanPseudo(constÂ StreamFormat&Â fmt, StreamBuffer& inputLine, size_t& cursor); `
:::

Now, `fmt.type` contains the value returned by `parse()`. With
`fmt.info()` get access to the string you have written to `info` in
`parse()` (null terminated).

The length of the info string can be found in `fmt.infolen`.

In `print*()`, append the converted value to `output`. Do not modify
what is already in output (unless you really know what you\'re doing,
e.g. some `printPseudo` methods). Return `true` on success, `false` on
failure.

In `scan*()`, read the value from input and return the number of
consumed bytes or -1 on failure. If the `skip_flag` is set, you don\'t
need to write to `value`, since the value will be discarded anyway. In
`scanString()`, don\'t write more bytes than `maxlen` to `value` and set
`size` to the actual string length, which may be different to the number
of bytes consumed (e.g. if leading spaces are skipped). In
`scanPseudo()`, `cursor` is the index of the first byte in `inputLine`
to consider, which may be larger than `0`.

# Format Converters {#formats.html__format-converters}

[]{#formats.html__syntax}

## 1. Format Syntax {#formats.html__format-syntax}

*StreamDevice* format converters work very similar to the format
converters of the C functions *printf()* and *scanf()*. But
*StreamDevice* provides more different converters and you can also write
your own converters. Formats are specified in [quoted
strings](#protocol.html__str) as arguments of `out` or `in`
[commands](#protocol.html__cmd).

A format converter consists of

-   The `%` character
-   Optionally a field or record name in `()`
-   Optionally flags out of the characters `*# +0-?=!`
-   Optionally an integer *width* field
-   Optionally a period character (`.`) followed by an integer
    *precision* field (input ony for most formats)
-   A conversion character
-   Additional information required by some converters

An exception is the sequence `%%` which stands for a single literal `%`.
This has been added for compatibility with the C functions *printf()*
and *scanf()*. It behaves the same as the escaped percent `\%`.

The flags `*# +0-` work like in the C functions *printf()* and
*scanf()*. The flags `?`, `=` and `!` are extensions.

The `*` flag skips data in input formats. Input is consumed and parsed,
a mismatch is an error, but the read data is dropped. This is useful if
input contains more than one value. Example: `in "%*f%f";` reads the
second floating point number.

The `#` flag may alter the format, depending on the converter (see
below).

The \'` `\' (space) and `+` flags usually print a space or a `+` sign
before positive numbers, where negative numbers would have a `-`. Some
converters may redefine the meaning of these flags (see below).

The `0` flag usually says that numbers should be left padded with `0` if
*width* is larger than required. Some converters may redefine the
meaning of this flag (see below).

The `-` flag usually specifies that output is left justified if *width*
is larger than required. Some converters may redefine the meaning of
this flag (see below).

The `?` flag makes failing input conversions succeed with a default zero
value (0, 0.0, or \"\", depending on the format type).

The `=` flag allows to compare input with current values. It is only
allowed in input formats. Instead of reading a new value from input, the
current value is formatted (like for output) and then compared to the
input.

The `!` flag demands that input is exactly *width* bytes long (normally
*width* defines the maximum number of bytes read in many formats). This
feature has been added by Klemen Vodopivec, SNS.

### Examples: {#formats.html__examples}

`in "%f";`

Read a float value

`out "%(HOPR)7.4f";`

Write the HOPR field as 7 char float with precision 4

`out "%#010x";`

Write a 0-padded 10 char hex integer using the alternative format (with
leading 0x)

`in "%[_a-zA-Z0-9]";`

Read a string of alphanumerical chars or underscores

`in "%*i";`

Skip over an integer number

`in "%?d";`

Read a decimal number or if that fails pretend that value was 0

`in "%=.3f";`

Assure that the input is equal to the current value formatted as a float
with precision 3

`in "%!5d";`

Expect exactly 5 decimal digits. Fewer digits are considered loss of
data and make the format fail.

`in "%d%%";`

Read a decimal number followed by a % sign

[]{#formats.html__types}

## 2. Data Types and Record Fields {#formats.html__data-types-and-record-fields}

### Default fields {#formats.html__default-fields}

Every conversion character corresponds to one of the data types DOUBLE,
LONG, ULONG, ENUM, or STRING. In contrast to to the C functions
*printf()* and *scanf()*, it is not required to specify a variable for
the conversion. The variable is typically the `VAL` or `RVAL` field of
the record, selected automatically depending on the data type. Not all
data types make sense for all record types. Refer to the description of
[supported record types](#recordtypes.html) for details.

*StreamDevice* makes no difference between `float` and `double` nor
between `short`, `int` and `long` values. Thus, data type modifiers like
`l` or `h` do not exist in *StreamDevice* formats.

[]{#formats.html__redirection}

### I/O Redirection to other records or fields {#formats.html__io-redirection-to-other-records-or-fields}

To use formats with other than the default fields of a record or even
with fields of other records on the same IOC, use the syntax
`%(``record`{.variable}`.``FIEL`{.variable}`D)`. If only a field name
but no record is given, the active record is assumed. If only a record
name but no field name is given, the `VAL` field is assumed.

**Example 1:** `outÂ "%(EGU)s";` outputs the `EGU` field of the active
record.

**Example 2:** `inÂ "%(``otherrecord`{.variable}`.RVAL)i";` stores the
received integer value in the `RVAL` field of the other record and then
processes that record. The other record should probably use
`DTYP="Raw Soft Channel"` in order to convert `RVAL` to `VAL`.

**Example 3:** `inÂ "%(``otherrecord`{.variable}`)f";` stores the
received floating point value in the `VAL` field of the other record and
then processes that record. The other record should probably use
`DTYP="Soft Channel"`. In the unlikely case that the name of the other
record is the same as a field of the active record (e.g. if you name a
record \"DESC\"), then use `.VAL` explicitly to refer to the record
rather than the field of the active record.

This feature is quite useful in the case that one line of input contains
more than one value that need to be stored in multiple records or if one
line of output needs to be contructed from values of multiple records.
In order to avoid using full record names in the protocol file, it is
recommended to pass the name or part of the name (e.g. the device
prefix) of the other record as a [protocol
argument](#protocol.html__argvar). In that case the redirection usually
looks like this: `in "%(\$1``recordpart`{.variable}`)f"` and the record
calls the protocol like this:
`field(INP, "@``protocolfile`{.variable}` ``protocol`{.variable}`($(PREFIX)) $(PORT)")`
using a macro for the prefix part which is then used for `\$1`.

If the other record is passive and the field has the PP attribute (see
[Record Reference
Manual](http://www.aps.anl.gov/asd/controls/epics/EpicsDocumentation/AppDevManuals/RecordRef/Recordref-1.html){target="ex"}),
the record will be processed. It is your responsibility that the data
type of the record field is compatible to the the data type of the
converter. STRING formats are compatible with arrays of CHAR or UCHAR.

Be aware that using this syntax is by far not as efficient as using the
default field. At the moment it is not possible to set the other record
to an alarm state if anything fails. It will simply not be processed if
the fault happens before or while handling it and it will already have
been processed if the fault happens later.

### Pseudo-converters {#formats.html__pseudo-converters}

Some formats are not actually converters. They format data which is not
stored in a record field, such as a [checksum](#formats.html__chksum) or
[regular expression substitution](#formats.html__regsub). No data type
corresponds to those *pseudo-converters* and the `%(`*`FIELD`*`)` syntax
cannot be used.

[]{#formats.html__stdd}

## 3. Standard DOUBLE Converters (`%f`, `%e`, `%E`, `%g`, `%G`) {#formats.html__standard-double-converters-f-e-e-g-g}

**Output:** `%f` prints fixed point, `%e` prints exponential notation
and `%g` prints either fixed point or exponential depending on the
magnitude of the value. `%E` and `%G` use `E` instead of `e` to separate
the exponent.

With the `#` flag, output always contains a period character.

**Input:** All these formats are equivalent. Leading whitespaces are
skipped.

With the `#` flag additional whitespace between sign and number is
accepted.

When a maximum field width is given, leading whitespace only counts to
the field witdth when the space flag is used.

[]{#formats.html__stdl}

## 4. Standard LONG and ULONG Converters (`%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%o`, `%x`, `%X`) {#formats.html__standard-long-and-ulong-converters-d-i-u-o-x-x}

**Output**: `%d` and `%i` print signed decimal, `%u` unsigned decimal,
`%o` unsigned octal, and `%x` or `%X` unsigned hexadecimal. `%X` uses
upper case letters.

With the `#` flag, octal values are prefixed with `0` and hexadecimal
values with `0x` or `0X`.

Unlike printf, `%x` and `%X` truncate the output to the the given width
(number of least significant half bytes).

**Input:** `%d` matches signed decimal, `%u` matches unsigned decimal,
`%o` unsigned octal. `%x` and `%X` both match upper or lower case
unsigned hexadecimal. Octal and hexadecimal values can optionally be
prefixed. `%i` matches any integer in decimal, or prefixed octal or
hexadecimal notation. Leading whitespaces are skipped.

With the `-` negative octal and hexadecimal values are accepted.

With the `#` flag additional whitespace between sign and number is
accepted.

When a maximum field width is given, leading whitespace only counts to
the field witdth when the space flag is used.

[]{#formats.html__stds}

## 5. Standard STRING Converters (`%s`, `%c`) {#formats.html__standard-string-converters-s-c}

**Output:** `%s` prints a string. If *precision* is specified, this is
the maximum string length. `%c` is a LONG format in output, printing one
character!

**Input:** `%s` matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters and `%c`
matches a sequence of not-null characters. The maximum string length is
given by *width*. The default *width* is infinite for `%s` and 1 for
`%c`. Leading whitespaces are skipped with `%s` except when the space
flag is used but not with `%c`. The empty string matches.

With the `#` flag `%s` matches a sequence of not-null characters instead
of non-whitespace characters.

With the `0` flag `%s` pads with 0 bytes instead of spaces.

[]{#formats.html__cset}

## 6. Standard Charset STRING Converter (`%[`*`charset`*`]`) {#formats.html__standard-charset-string-converter-charset}

This is an input-only format. It matches a sequence of characters from
*charset*. If *charset* starts with `^`, the format matches all
characters [not]{.underline} in *charset*. Leading whitespaces are not
skipped.

Example: `%[_a-z]` matches a string consisting entirely of `_`
(underscore) or letters from `a` to `z`.

[]{#formats.html__enum}

## 7. ENUM Converter (`%{`*`string0`*`|`*`string1`*`|...}`) {#formats.html__enum-converter-string0string1...}

This format maps an unsigned integer value on a set of strings. The
value 0 corresponds to *string0* and so on. The strings are separated by
`|`.

Example: `%{OFF|STANDBY|ON}` mapps the string `OFF` to the value 0,
`STANDBY` to 1 and `ON` to 2.

When using the `#` flag it is allowed to assign integer values to the
strings using `=`. Unassigned strings increment their values by 1 as
usual.

If one string is the initial substing of another, the substing must come
later to ensure correct matching. In particular if one string is the
emptry string, it must be the last one because it always matches. Use
`#` and `=` to renumber if necessary.

Use the assignment `=?` for the last string to make it the default value
for output formats.

Example: `%#{neg=-1|stop|pos|fast=10|rewind=-10}`.

If one of the strings contains `|` or `}` (or `=` if the `#` flag is
used) a `\` must be used to escape the character.

**Output:** Depending on the value, one of the strings is printed, or
the default if given and no value matches.

**Input:** If any of the strings matches, the value is set accordingly.

[]{#formats.html__bin}

## 8. Binary LONG or ULONG Converter (`%b`, `%B`*`zo`*) {#formats.html__binary-long-or-ulong-converter-b-bzo}

This format prints or scans an unsigned integer represented as a binary
string (one character per bit). The `%b` format uses the characters `0`
and `1`. With the `%B` format, you can choose two other characters to
represent zero and one. With the `#` flag, the bit order is changed to
*little endian*, i.e. least significant bit first.

Examples: `%B.!` or `%B\x00\xff`. `%B01` is equivalent to `%b`.

In output, if *width* is larger than the number of significant bits,
then the flag `0` means that the value should be padded with with the
chosen zero character instead of spaces. If *precision* is set, it means
the number of significant bits. Otherwise, the highest 1 bit defines the
number of significant bits.

In input, leading spaces are skipped. A maximum of *width* characters is
read. Conversion stops with the first character that is not the zero or
the one character.

[]{#formats.html__raw}

## 9. Raw LONG or ULONG Converter (`%r`) {#formats.html__raw-long-or-ulong-converter-r}

The raw converter does not really \"convert\". A signed or unsigned
integer value is written or read in the internal (usually two\'s
complement) representation of the computer. The normal byte order is
*big endian*, i.e. most significant byte first. With the `#` flag, the
byte order is changed to *little endian*, i.e. least significant byte
first. With the `0` flag, the value is unsigned, otherwise signed.

In output, the *precision* (or sizeof(long) whatever is less) least
significant bytes of the value are sign extended or zero extended
(depending on the `0` flag) to *width* bytes. The default for
*precision* is 1. Thus if you do not specify the *precision*, only the
least significant byte is written! It is common error to write
`out "%2r";` instead of `out "%.2r";`.

In input, *width* bytes are read and put into the value. If *width* is
larger than the size of a `long`, only the least significant bytes are
used. If *width* is smaller than the size of a `long`, the value is sign
extended or zero extended, depending on the `0` flag.

Examples: `out "%.2r"; in "%02r";`

[]{#formats.html__rawdouble}

## 10. Raw DOUBLE Converter (`%R`) {#formats.html__raw-double-converter-r}

The raw converter does not really \"convert\". A float or double value
is written or read in the internal (maybe IEEE) representation of the
computer. The normal byte order is *big endian*, i.e. most significant
byte first. With the `#` flag, the byte order is changed to *little
endian*, i.e. least significant byte first. The *width* must be 4
(float) or 8 (double). The default is 4.

[]{#formats.html__bcd}

## 11. Packed BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) LONG or ULONG Converter (`%D`) {#formats.html__packed-bcd-binary-coded-decimal-long-or-ulong-converter-d}

Packed BCD is a format where each byte contains two binary coded decimal
digits (`0` \... `9`). Thus a BCD byte is in the range from `0x00` to
`0x99`. The normal byte order is *big endian*, i.e. most significant
byte first. With the `#` flag, the byte order is changed to *little
endian*, i.e. least significant byte first. The `+` flag defines that
the value is signed, using the upper half of the most significant byte
for the sign. Otherwise the value is unsigned.

In output, *precision* decimal digits are printed in at least *width*
output bytes. Signed negative values have `0xF` in their most
significant half byte followed by the absolute value.

In input, *width* bytes are read. If the value is signed, a one in the
most significant bit is interpreted as a negative sign. Input stops with
the first byte (after the sign) that does not represent a BCD value,
i.e. where either the upper or the lower half byte is larger than 9.

[]{#formats.html__chksum}

## 12. Checksum Pseudo-Converter (`%<`*`checksum`*`>`) {#formats.html__checksum-pseudo-converter-checksum}

This is not a normal \"converter\", because no user data is converted.
Instead, a checksum is calculated from the input or output. The *width*
field is the byte number from which to start calculating the checksum.
Default is 0, i.e. the first byte of the input or output of the current
command. The last byte is *precision* bytes before the checksum (default
0). For example in `"abcdefg%<xor>"` the checksum is calculated from
`abcdefg`, but in `"abcdefg%2.1<xor>"` only from `cdef`.

Normally, multi-byte checksums are in *big endian* byteorder, i.e. most
significant byte first. With the `#` flag, the byte order is changed to
*little endian*, i.e. least significant byte first.

The `0` flag changes the checksum representation to hexadecimal ASCII (2
chars per checksum byte).

The `-` flag changes the checksum representation to \"poor man\'s hex\":
0x30 \... 0x3f (2 chars per checksum byte).

The `+` flag changes the checksum representation to decimal ASCII
(formatted with %d).

In output, the checksum is appended.

In input, the next byte or bytes must match the checksum.

[]{#formats.html__regex}

## 13. Regular Expresion STRING Converter (`%/`*`regex`*`/`) {#formats.html__regular-expresion-string-converter-regex}

This input-only format matches [Perl compatible regular expressions
(PCRE)](http://www.pcre.org/){target="ex"}. It is only available if a
PCRE library is installed.

::: box
If PCRE is not available for your host or cross architecture, download
the sourcecode from [www.pcre.org](https://www.pcre.org/){target="ex"}
and try my EPICS compatible
[Makefile](http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/pcre/Makefile){target="ex"}
to compile it like a normal EPICS support module. The Makefile is known
to work with EPICS 3.14.8 and PCRE 7.2. In your RELEASE file define the
variable `PCRE` so that it points to the install location of PCRE.

If PCRE is already installed on (some of) your systems, you may add
architectures where PCRE can be found in standard include and library
locations to the variable `WITH_SYSTEM_PCRE`. If either the header file
or the library are in a non-standard place, set in your RELEASE file the
variables `PCRE_INCLUDE_`*`arch`* and/or `PCRE_LIB_`*`arch`* for the
respective architectures to the correct directories or set
`PCRE_INCLUDE` and/or `PCRE_LIB` in architecture specific
RELEASE.Common.*arch* files.
:::

If the regular expression is not anchored, i.e. does not start with `^`,
leading non-matching input is skipped. To match in multiline mode
(across newlines) add `(?m)` at the beginning of the pattern. To match
case insensitive, add `(?i)`.

A maximum of *width* bytes is matched, if specified. If *precision* is
given, it specifies the sub-expression in `()` whose match is returned.
Otherwise the complete match is returned. In any case, the complete
match is consumed from the input buffer. If the expression contains a
`/` it must be escaped like `\/`.

Example: `%.1/<title>(.*)<\/title>/` returns the title of an HTML page,
skipps anything before the `<title>` tag and leaves anything after the

## 14. Regular Expresion Substitution Pseudo-Converter (`%#/`*`regex`*`/`*`subst`*`/`) {#formats.html__regular-expresion-substitution-pseudo-converter-regexsubst}

This is a variant of the previous converter (note the `#`) but instead
of returning the matching string, it can be used as a pre-processor for
input or as a post-processor for output.

Matches of the *regex* are replaced by the string *subst* with all `&`
in *subst* replaced with the match itself and all `\1` through `\9`
replaced with the match of the corresponding sub-expression [ if such a
sub-expression exists. Occurrences of `\U`*`n`*, `\L`*`n`*, `\u`*`n`*,
or `\l`*`n`* with *`n`* being a number `0` through `9` or `&` are
replaced with the corresponding sub-expression converted to all upper
case, all lower case, first letter upper case, or first letter lower
case, respectively.]{.new}

[ Due to limitations of the parser, `\1` and `\x01` are the same which
makes it difficult to use literal bytes with values lower than 10 in
*subst*. Therefore `\0` aways means a literal byte (incompatible change
from earlier version!) and `\1` through `\9` mean literal bytes if they
are larger than the number of sub-expressions. ]{.new} To get a literal
`&` or `\` or `/` in the substitution write `\&` or `\\` or `\/`.

If *width* is specified, it limits the number of characters processed.
If the `-` flag is used (i.e. *width* looks like a negative number) only
the last *width* characters are processed, else the first. Without
*width* (or 0) all available characters are processed.

If *precision* is specified, it indicates which matches to replace. With
the `+` flag given, *precision* is the maximum number of matches to
replace. Otherwise *precision* is the index (counting from 1) of the
match to replace. Without *precision* (or 0), all matches are replaced.

When replacing multiple matches, the next match is searched directly
after the currently replaced string, so that the *subst* string itself
will never be modified recursively. [ However if an empty string is
matched, searching advances by 1 character in order to avoid matching
the same empty string again.]{.new}

In input this converter pre-processes data received from the device
before following converters read it. Converters preceding this one will
read unmodified input. Thus place this converter before those whose
input should be pre-processed.

In output it post-processes data already formatted by preceding
converters before sending it to the device. Converters following this
one will send their output unmodified. Thus place this converter after
those whose output should be post-processed.

Examples:

::: indent
`%#+-10.2/ab/X/` replaces the string `ab` with `X` maximal 2 times in
the last 10 characters. (`abcabcabcabc` becomes `abcXcXcabc`)
:::

::: indent
`%#/\\/\//` replaces all `\` with `/` (`\dir\file` becomes `/dir/file`)
:::

::: indent
`%#/..\B/&:/` inserts `:` after every second character which is not at
the end of a word. (`0b19353134` becomes `0b:19:35:31:34`)
:::

::: indent
`%#/://` removes all `:` characters. (`0b:19:35:31:34` becomes
`0b19353134`)
:::

::: indent
`%#/([^+-])*([+-])/\2\1/` moves a postfix sign to the front. (`1.23-`
becomes `-1.23`)\
:::

::: indent
`%#-2/.*/\U0/` converts the previous 2 characters to upper case.

## 15. MantissaExponent DOUBLE converter (`%m`) {#formats.html__mantissaexponent-double-converter-m}

This exotic and experimental format matches numbers in the format
*\[sign\] mantissa sign exponent*, e.g `+123-4` meaning 123e-4 or
0.0123. Mantissa and exponent are decimal integers. The sign of the
mantissa is optional. Compared to the standard `%e` format, this format
does not contain the characters `.` and `e`.

Output formatting is ambigous (e.g. `123-4` versus `1230-5`). I chose
the following convention: Format *precision* defines number of digits in
mantissa. No leading \'0\' in mantissa (except for 0.0 of course).
Number of digits in exponent is at least 2. Format flags `+`, `-`, and
space are supported in the usual way (always sign, left justified, space
instead of + sign). Flags `#` and `0` are unsupported.

[]{#formats.html__timestamp}

## 16. Timestamp DOUBLE converter (`%T(`*`timeformat`*`)`) {#formats.html__timestamp-double-converter-ttimeformat}

This format reads or writes timestamps and converts them to a double
number. The value represents the number of seconds since 1970 (the UNIX
epoch). The precision of a double is large enough for microseconds (but
not for nanoseconds). This format is probably used best in combination
with a redirection to the `TIME` field. In this case, the value is
converted to EPICS timestamps (seconds since 1990 and nanoseconds). The
timestamp format understands the usual converters that the C function
*strftime()* understands. In addition, fractions of a second can be
specified and the time zone can be set in the format string.

Example: `%(TIME)T(%d %b %Y %H:%M:%.3S %z)` may print something like
` 3 Sep 2010 15:45:59 +0200`.

Fractions of a second can be specified as `%.`*`n`*`S` (seconds with *n*
fractional digits), as `%0`*`n`*`f` or `%`*`n`*`f` (*n* fractional
digits) or as `%N` (nanoseconds). In input, *n* is the maximum number of
digits parsed, there may be actually less digits in the input. If *n* is
not specified (`%.S` or `%f`) it uses a default value of 6.

In input, the time zone can be specified in the format like `%+`*`hhmm`*
or `%-`*`hhmm`* for cases where the parsed time stamp does not specify
the time zone, where *hhmm* is a 4 digit number specifying the offset in
hours and minutes.

In output, the system function *strftime()* is used to format the time.
There may be differences in the implementation between operating
systems.

In input, *StreamDevice* uses its own implementation because many
systems are missing the *strptime()* function and additional formats are
supported.

Day of the week can be parsed but is ignored because the information is
redundant when used together with day, month and year and more or less
useless otherwise. No check is done for consistency.

Because of the complexity of the problem, locales are not supported.
Thus, only the English month names can be used (week day names are
ignored anyway).

# EPICS *StreamDevice* {#index.html__epics-streamdevice}

## What is *StreamDevice*? {#index.html__what-is-streamdevice}

*StreamDevice* is a generic [EPICS](https://epics.anl.gov/){target="ex"}
device support for devices with a \"byte stream\" based communication
interface. That means devices that can be controlled by sending and
receiving strings (in the broadest sense, including non-printable
characters and even null-bytes). Examples for this type of communication
interface are serial line (RS-232, RS-485, \...), IEEE-488 (also known
as GPIB or HP-IB), and telnet-like TCP/IP.

*StreamDevice* is not limited to a specific device type or manufacturer
nor is it necessary to re-compile anything to support a new device type.
Instead, it can be configured for any device type with [*protocol
files*](#protocol.html) in plain ASCII text which describes the commands
a device understands and the replies it sends. If the device can be
controlled with strings like \"[RF:FREQ 499.655 MHZ]{.kbd}\"
*StreamDevice* can be used. Formatting and parsing of values is done
with [*format converters*](#formats.html) similar to those known from
the C functions *printf()* and *scanf()*. To support other formats, it
is possible to [write your own converters](#formatconverter.html).

Each record with *StreamDevice* support runs one protocol from the
protocol file to read or write its value. Protocols can be as simple as
just one output string or can consist of many strings sent to and read
from the device. However, a protocol is linear. That means it runs from
start to end each time the record is [processed](#processing.html). It
does not provide loops or branches.

*StreamDevice* comes with an interface to
[*asynDriver*](https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/){target="ex"}
but can be extended to [support other bus drivers](#businterface.html).
Note that *StreamDevice* is not an alternative or replacement but a
supplement for *asynDriver*. *StreamDevice* converts record values to
and from strings but leaves it to *asynDriver* (or other bus interfaces)
to exchange these strings with the device. Thus any bus type supported
by *asynDriver* (to be exact by *asynOctet*) can automatically be used
with *StreamDevice*.

*StreamDevice* supports all [standard records](#recordtypes.html) of
EPICS base which can have device support. It is also possible to [write
support for new record types](#recordinterface.html).

## What is *StreamDevice* not? {#index.html__what-is-streamdevice-not}

It is not a programming language for a high-level application. It is,
for example, not possible to write a complete scanning program in a
protocol. Use other tools for that and use *StreamDevice* only for the
primitive commands.

It is not a block oriented device support. It is not intended for huge
binary blocks of data that contain many process variables distributed
over many records. Consider
[*regDev*](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/regdev){target="ex"}
for that.

It is not a very flexible html, xml, json, etc. parser. Data needs to
come in a predictible order to be parsable by *StreamDevice*.

        \... `FFVL` depending on `VAL` and by shifting it left by `SHFT`
        bits.\
        [Input:]{.underline} `RBV=RVAL=`*`x`*`&MASK`\
        `MASK` is initialized to `NOBT` 1-bits shifted left by `SHFT`.
        If `MASK==0` (because `NOBT` was not set) it is ignored, i.e.
        *`x`*`=RVAL` and `RBV=RVAL=`*`x`*.

    If none of `ZRVL` \... `FFVL` is set (all are `0`):
    :   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=(VAL<<SHFT)&MASK`\
        [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=(RBV=(`*`x`*`&MASK))>>SHFT`\

STRING format (e.g. `%s`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} Depending on `VAL`, one of `ZRST` \... `FFST`
    is written. `VAL` must be in the range 0 \... 15.\
    [Input:]{.underline} If input is equal one of `ZRST` \... `FFST`,
    `VAL` is set accordingly. Other input strings are not accepted.

Depending on the format type, different record fields are used for
output and input. The variable *`x`* stands for the written or read
value.

DOUBLE format (e.g. `%f`):
:   Not allowed.

LONG or ENUM format (e.g. `%i`):

:   

    If `MASK==0` (because `NOBT` is not set):
    :   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=RVAL`\
        [Input:]{.underline} `RAL=`*`x`*, `VAL=RVAL>>SHFT`\

        [Input:]{.underline} `RBV=RVAL=`*`x`*`&MASK`, `VAL=RVAL>>SHFT`\

    `MASK` is initialized to `NOBT` 1-bits shifted left by `SHFT`
    (`((2^NOBT)-1)<<SHFT`). The record calculates `RVAL=VAL<<SHFT`.

STRING format (e.g. `%s`):
:   Not allowed.

# Record Processing {#processing.html__record-processing}

[]{#processing.html__proc}

## 1. Normal Processing {#processing.html__normal-processing}

*StreamDevice* is an asynchronous device support (see [IOC Application
Developer\'s
Guide](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/12-docs/AppDevGuide.pdf){target="ex"}
chapter 12: Device Support). Whenever the record is processed, the
[protocol](#protocol.html) is scheduled to start and the record is left
active (`PACT=1`). The protocol itself runs in another thread. That
means that any waiting in the protocol does not delay any other part of
the IOC.

After the protocol has finished, the record is processed again, leaving
`PACT=0` this time, triggering monitors and processing the forward link
`FLNK`. Note that input links with PP flag pointing to a *StreamDevice*
record will read the [old]{.underline} value first and start the
protocol afterward. This is a problem all asynchronous EPICS device
supports have.

The first `out` command in the protocol locks the device for exclusive
access. That means that no other record can communicate with that
device. This ensures that replies given by the device reach the record
which has sent the request. On a bus with many devices on different
addresses, this normally locks only one device. The device is unlocked
when the protocol terminates. Another record trying to lock the same
device has to wait and might get a `LockTimeout`.

If any error happens, the protocol is aborted. The record will have its
`SEVR` field set to `INVALID` and its `STAT` field to something
describing the error:

`TIMEOUT`
:   The device could not be locked (`LockTimeout`) because other records
    are keeping the device busy or the device did not reply in time
    ([`ReplyTimeout`](#protocol.html__sysvar)).

`WRITE`
:   Output could not be written to the device in time
    ([`WriteTimeout`](#protocol.html__sysvar)).

`READ`
:   Input from the device started but stopped unexpectedly
    ([`ReadTimeout`](#protocol.html__sysvar)).

`COMM`
:   The device driver reported that the device is disconnected.

`CALC`
:   Input did not match the argument string of the `in` command or it
    contained values the record did not accept.

`UDF`
:   Some fatal error happened or the record has not been initialized
    correctly (e.g. because the protocol is erroneous).

If the protocol is aborted, an [exception
handler](#protocol.html__except) might be executed if defined. Even if
the exception handler can complete with no further error, the protocol
will not resume and `SEVR` and `STAT` will be set according to the
original error.

[]{#processing.html__init}

## 2. Initialization {#processing.html__initialization}

Often, it is useful to initialize records from the hardware after
booting the IOC, especially output records. For this purpose,
initialization is formally handled as an
[exception](#protocol.html__except). The `@init` handler is called as
part of the `initRecord()` function during `iocInit` before any scan
task starts [and may be re-run later under circumstances listed
below]{.new}.

In contrast to [normal processing](#processing.html__proc), the protocol
is handled synchronously. That means that `initRecord()` does not return
before the `@init` handler has finished. Thus, the records initialize
one after the other. The scan tasks are not started and `iocInit` does
not return before all `@init` handlers have finished. If the handler
fails, the record remains uninitialized: `UDF=1`, `SEVR=INVALID`,
`STAT=UDF`.

The `@init` handler has nothing to do with the `PINI` field. The handler
does [not]{.underline} process the record nor does it trigger forward
links or any links with the `PP` flag. It runs [before]{.underline}
`PINI` is handled. If the record has `PINI=YES`, the `PINI` processing
is a [normal processing](#processing.html__proc) after the `@init`
handlers of all records have completed.

Depending on the record type, format converters might work slightly
different from normal processing. Refer to the description of [supported
record types](#recordtypes.html) for details.

If the `@init`handler has read a value and has completed without error,
the record starts in a defined state. That means `UDF=0`,
`SEVR=NO_ALARM`, `STAT=NO_ALARM` and the `VAL` field contains the value
read from the device.

If no `@init` handler is installed, `VAL` and `RVAL` fields remain
untouched. That means they contain the value defined in the record
definition, read from a constant `INP` or `DOL` field, or restored from
a bump-less reboot system (e.g. *autosave* from the *synApps* package).

The `@init` handler is called in the following situations:

-   At startup by `iocInit` during record initialization as described
    above.
-   When the IOC is resumed with `iocRun` (after beeing paused with
    `iocPause`) before the scan tasks restart and before records with
    `PINI=RUN` are processed.
-   When the protocol is [reloaded](#setup.html__reload) for example
    with `streamReload ["``recordname`{.variable}`"]`.
-   When *StreamDevice* detects that the device has reconnected (after
    being disconnected). This includes the case that the device was
    disconnected when the IOC started. Be aware that some drivers test
    the connection only periodically, e.g. the *asynIPPort* driver tests
    it every few seconds. Thus there may be a small delay between the
    device being online and the record re-initializing.
-   When
    `streamReinit "``asynPortname`{.variable}`"[,``addr`{.variable}`]`
    is called (if using an *asynDriver* port).
-   When the \"magic value\" `2` is written to the `.PROC` field of the
    record. In this case the record is processed and thus its `FLNK` and
    links with the `PP` flag are triggered.

[]{#processing.html__iointr}

## 3. I/O Intr {#processing.html__io-intr}

*StreamDevice* supports I/O event scanning. This is a mode where record
processing is triggered by the device whenever the device sends input.

In terms of protocol execution this means: When the `SCAN` field is set
to `I/O Intr` (during `iocInit` or later), the protocol starts without
processing the record. With the first `in` command, the protocol is
suspended. If the device has been locked (i.e there was an `out` command
earlier in the protocol), it is unlocked now. That means that other
records can communicate to the device while this record is waiting for
input. This `in` command ignores `replyTimeout`, it waits forever.

The protocol now receives any input from the device. It also gets a copy
of all input directed to other records. Non-matching input does not
generate a mismatch [exception](#protocol.html__except). It just
restarts the `in` command until matching input is received.

After receiving matching input, the protocol continues normally. All
other `in` commands are handled normally. When the protocol has
completed, the record is processed. It then triggers monitors, forward
links, etc. After the record has been processed, the protocol restarts.

This mode is useful in two cases: First for devices that send data
automatically without being asked. Second to distribute multiple values
in one message to different records. In this case, one record would send
a request to the device and pick only one value out of the reply. The
other values are read by records in `I/O Intr` mode.

### Example: {#processing.html__example}

Device *dev1* has a \"region of interest\" (ROI) defined by a start
value and an end value. When asked \"`ROI?`\", it replies something like
\"`ROI 17.3 58.7`\", i.e. a string containing both values.

We need two ai records to store the two values. Whenever record
`ROI:start` is processed, it requests ROI from the device. Record
`ROI:end` updates automatically.

    record (ai "ROI:start") {
        field (DTYP, "stream")
        field (INP,  "@myDev.proto getROIstart dev1")
    }
    record (ai "ROI:end") {
        field (DTYP, "stream")
        field (INP,  "@myDev.proto getROIend dev1")
        field (SCAN, "I/O Intr")
    }

Only one of the two protocols sends a request, but both read their part
of the same reply message.

    getROIstart {
        out "ROI?";
        in  "ROI %f %*f";
    }
    getROIend {
        in  "ROI %*f %f";
    }

Note that the other value is also parsed by each protocol, but skipped
because of the `%*` [format](#formats.html). Even though the `getROIend`
protocol may receive input from other requests, it silently ignores
every message that does not start with \"`ROI`\", followed by two
floating point numbers.

[Next: Supported Record Types](#recordtypes.html) Dirk Zimoch, 2018
:::

::: {#protocol.html}
# Protocol Files {#protocol.html__protocol-files}

[]{#protocol.html__gen}

## 1. General Information {#protocol.html__general-information}

A protocol file describes the communication with one device type. It
contains [*protocols*](#protocol.html__proto) for each function of the
device type and [*variables*](#protocol.html__var) which affect how the
[*commands*](#protocol.html__cmd) in a protocol work. It does not
contain information about the individual device or the used
communication bus.

Each device type should have its own protocol file. I suggest to choose
a file name that contains the name of the device type. Don\'t use spaces
in the file name and keep it short. The file will be referenced by its
name in the `INP` or `OUT` link of the records which use it. The
protocol file must be stored in one of the directories listed in the
environment variable `STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH` (see chapter
[Setup](#setup.html__sta)).

The protocol file is a plain text file. Everything not enclosed in
quotes (single `'` or double `"`) is not case sensitive. This includes
the names of [commands](#protocol.html__cmd),
[protocols](#protocol.html__proto) and [variables](#protocol.html__var).
There may be any amount of whitespaces (space, tab, newline, \...) or
comments between names, [quoted strings](#protocol.html__str) and
special characters, such as `={};`. A comment is everything starting
from an unquoted `#` until the end of the line.

### Example Protocol File: {#protocol.html__example-protocol-file}

    # This is an example protocol file

    Terminator = CR LF;

    # Frequency is a float
    # use ai and ao records

    getFrequency {
        out "FREQ?"; in "%f";
    }

    setFrequency {
        out "FREQ %f";
        @init { getFrequency; }
    }

    # Switch is an enum, either OFF or ON
    # use bi and bo records

    getSwitch {
        out "SW?"; in "SW %{OFF|ON}";
    }

    setSwitch {
        out "SW %{OFF|ON}";
        @init { getSwitch; }
    }

    # Connect a stringout record to this to get
    # a generic command interface.
    # After processing finishes, the record contains the reply.

    debug {
        ExtraInput = Ignore;
        out "%s"; in "%39c"
    }

[]{#protocol.html__proto}

## 2. Protocols {#protocol.html__protocols}

For each function of the device type, define one protocol. A protocol
consists of a name followed by a body in braces `{}`. The name must be
unique within the protocol file. It is used to reference the protocol in
the `INP` or `OUT` link of the record, thus keep it short. It should
describe the function of the protocol. It must not contain spaces or any
of the characters `,;={}()$'"\#`.

The protocol body contains a sequence of [commands](#protocol.html__cmd)
and optionally [variable assignments](#protocol.html__var) separated by
`;`.

### Referencing other protocols {#protocol.html__referencing-other-protocols}

To save some typing, a previously defined protocol can be called inside
another protocol like a [command](#protocol.html__cmd) without
parameters. The protocol name is replaced by the commands in the
referenced protocol. However, this does not include any [variable
assignments](#protocol.html__var) or [exception
handlers](#protocol.html__except) from the referenced protocol. See the
`@init` handlers in the above example.

### Limitations {#protocol.html__limitations}

The *StreamDevice* protocol is not a programming language. It has
neither loops nor conditionals (in this version of *StreamDevice*).
However, if an error occurs, e.g. a timeout or a mismatch in input
parsing, an [exception handler](#protocol.html__excep) can be called to
clean up.

[]{#protocol.html__cmd}

## 3. Commands {#protocol.html__commands}

Seven different commands can be used in a protocol: `out`, `in`, `wait`,
`event`, `exec`, `disconnect`, and `connect`. Most protocols will
consist only of a single `out` command to write some value, or an `out`
command followed by an `in` command to read a value. But there can be
any number of commands in a protocol.

`out `*`string`*`;`
:   Write output to the device. The argument
    [string](#protocol.html__str) may contain [format
    converters](#formats.html) which are replaced by the formatted value
    of the record before sending.

`in `*`string`*`;`
:   Read and parse input from the device. The argument
    [string](#protocol.html__str) may contain [format
    converters](#formats.html) which specify how to interpret data to be
    put into the record. Input must match the argument string. Any input
    from the device should be consumed with an `in` command. If a
    device, for example, acknowledges a setting, use an `in` command to
    check the acknowledge, even though it contains no user data.

`wait `*`milliseconds`*`;`
:   Just wait for some milliseconds. Depending on the resolution of the
    timer system, the actual delay can be slightly longer than
    specified.

`event(`*`eventcode`*`) `*`milliseconds`*`;`
:   Wait for event *`eventcode`* with some timeout. What an event
    actually means depends on the used [bus](#businterface.html__event).
    Some buses do not support events at all, some provide many different
    events. If the bus supports only one event, `(`*`eventcode`*`)` is
    dispensable.

`exec `*`string`*`;`
:   The argument [string](#protocol.html__str) is passed to the IOC
    shell as a command to execute.

`disconnect;`
:   Disconnect from the hardware. This is probably not supported by all
    busses. Any `in` or `out` command will automatically reconnect. Only
    records reading in [\"I/O Intr\"](#processing.html__iointr) mode
    will not cause a reconnect.

`connect `*`milliseconds`*`;`
:   Explicitely connect to the hardware with *`milliseconds`* timeout.
    Since connection is handled automatically, this command is normally
    not needed. It may be useful after a `disconnect`.

[]{#protocol.html__str}

## 4. Strings {#protocol.html__strings}

In a *StreamDevice* protocol file, strings can be written as quoted
literals (single quotes or double quotes), as a sequence of bytes
values, or as a combination of both.

Examples for quoted literals are:\
`"That's a string."`\
`'Say "Hello"'`

There is no difference between double quoted and single quoted literals,
it just makes it easier to use quotes of the other type in a string. To
break long strings into multiple lines of the protocol file, close the
quotes before the line break and reopen them in the next line. Don\'t
use a line break inside quotes.

As arguments of `out` or `in` [commands](#protocol.html__cmd), string
literals can contain [format converters](#formats.html). A format
converter starts with `%` and works similar to formats in the C
functions *printf()* and *scanf()*.

*StreamDevice* uses the backslash character `\` to define some escape
sequences in quoted string literals:\
`\"`, `\'`, `\%`, and `\\` mean literal `"`, `'`, `%`, and `\`.\
`\a` means *alarm bell* (ASCII code 7).\
`\b` means *backspace* (ASCII code 8).\
`\t` means *tab* (ASCII code 9).\
`\n` means *new line* (ASCII code 10).\
`\r` means *carriage return* (ASCII code 13).\
`\e` means *escape* (ASCII code 27).\
`\x` followed by up to two hexadecimal digits means a byte with that hex
value.\
`\0` followed by up to three octal digits means a byte with that octal
value.\
`\1` to `\9` followed by up to two more decimal digits means a byte with
that decimal value.\
`\?` in input matches any byte, in output it does not print anything.\
[ `\_` in input matches any amount of white space (including none), in
output it prints a single space.\
]{.new} `\$` followed by the name of a [protocol
varible](#protocol.html__var) is replaced by the contents of that
variable.

For non-printable characters, it is often easier to write sequences of
byte values instead of escaped quoted string literals. A byte is written
as an unquoted decimal, hexadecimal, or octal number in the range of
`-128` to `255`, `-0x80` to `0xff` (not case sesitive), or `-0200` to
`0377`, respectively.

*StreamDevice* also recognizes the ASCII symbolic names (not case
sensitive) for several byte codes:\
`NUL `(= `0x00`) *null*\
`SOH `(= `0x01`) *start of heading*\
`STX `(= `0x02`) *start of text*\
`ETX `(= `0x03`) *end of text*\
`EOT `(= `0x04`) *end of transmission*\
`ENQ `(= `0x05`) *enquiry*\
`ACK `(= `0x06`) *acknowledge*\
`BEL `(= `0x07`) *bell*\
`BSÂ  `(= `0x08`) *backspace*\

A single string can be built from several quoted literals and byte
values by writing them separated by whitespaces or comma.

`"Hello world\r\n"`\
`'Hello',0x20,"world",CR,LF`\
`72 101 108 108 111 32 119 111 114 108 100 13 10`

[]{#protocol.html__var}

## 5. Protocol Variables {#protocol.html__protocol-variables}

*StreamDevice* uses three types of variables in a protocol file.
[*System variables*](#protocol.html__sysvar) influence the behavior of
`in` and `out` [commands](#protocol.html__cmd). [*Protocol
arguments*](#protocol.html__argvar) work like function arguments and can
be specified in the `INP` or `OUT` link of the record. [*User
variables*](#protocol.html__usrvar) can be defined and used in the
protocol as abbreviations for often used values.

System and user variables can be set in the global context of the
protocol file or locally inside protocols. When set globally, a variable
keeps its value until overwritten. When set locally, a variable is valid
inside the protocol only. To set a variable use the syntax:\
*`variable`*` = `*`value`*`;`

Set variables can be referenced outside of [quoted
strings](#protocol.html__str) by `$`*`variable`* or `${`*`variable`*`}`
and inside quoted strings by `\$`*`variable`* or `\${`*`variable`*`}`.
The reference will be replaced by the value of the variable at this
point.

[]{#protocol.html__sysvar}

### System variables {#protocol.html__system-variables}

This is a list of system variables, their default settings and what they
influence.

`LockTimeout = 5000;`
:   Integer. Affects first `out` command in a protocol.\
    If other records currently use the device, how many milliseconds to
    wait for exclusive access to the device before giving up?

`WriteTimeout = 100;`
:   Integer. Affects `out` commands.\
    If we have access to the device but output cannot be written
    immediately, how many milliseconds to wait before giving up?

`ReplyTimeout = 1000;`
:   Integer. Affects `in` commands.\
    Different devices need different times to calculate a reply and
    start sending it. How many milliseconds to wait for the first byte
    of the input from the device? Since several other records may be
    waiting to access the device during this time, `LockTimeout` should
    be larger than `ReplyTimeout`.

`ReadTimeout = 100;`
:   Integer. Affects `in` commands.\
    The device may send input in pieces (e.g. bytes). When it stops
    sending, how many milliseconds to wait for more input bytes before
    giving up? If `InTerminator = ""`, a read timeout is not an error
    but a valid input termination.

`PollPeriod = $ReplyTimeout;`
:   Integer. Affects first `in` command in `I/O Intr` mode (see chapter
    [Record Processing](#processing.html__iointr)).\
    In that mode, some buses require periodic polling to get
    asynchronous input if no other record executes an `in` command at
    the moment. How many milliseconds to wait after last poll or last
    received input before polling again? A good value is about half the
    time of the expected input period. Longer values cause latency and
    shorter values may increase CPU consumption. If not set the same
    value as for `ReplyTimeout` is used.

`Terminator`
:   String. Affects `out` and `in` commands.\
    Most devices send and expect terminators after each message, e.g.
    `CR LF`. The value of the `Terminator` variable is automatically
    appended to any output. It is also used to find the end of input. It
    is removed before the input is passed to the `in` command. If no
    `Terminator` or `InTerminator` is defined, the underlying driver may
    use its own terminator settings. For example, *asynDriver* defines
    its own terminator settings.

`OutTerminator = $Terminator;`
:   String. Affects `out` commands.\
    If a device has different terminators for input and output, use this
    for the output terminator.

`InTerminator = $Terminator;`
:   String. Affects `in` commands.\
    If a device has different terminators for input and output, use this
    for the input terminator. If no `Terminator` or `InTerminator` is
    defined, the underlying driver may use its own terminator settings.
    If `InTerminator = ""`, a read timeout is not an error but a valid
    input termination.

`MaxInput = 0;`
:   Integer. Affects `in` commands.\
    Some devices don\'t send terminators but always send a fixed message
    size. How many bytes to read before terminating input even without
    input terminator or read timeout? The value `0` means \"infinite\".

`Separator = "";`
:   String. Affects `out` and `in` commands.\
    When formatting or parsing array values in a format converter (see
    [formats](#formats.html) and [waveform record](#waveform.html)),
    what string to write or to expect between values? [ ~~If the first
    character of the `Separator` is a space, it matches any number of
    any whitespace characters in an `in` command.~~ To match arbitrary
    amount of whitespace in input, use `"\_"`. ]{.new}

`ExtraInput = Error;`
:   `Error` or `Ignore`. Affects `in` commands.\
    Normally, when input parsing has completed, any bytes left in the
    input are treated as parse error. If extra input bytes should be
    ignored, set `ExtraInput = Ignore;`

[]{#protocol.html__argvar}

### Protocol arguments {#protocol.html__protocol-arguments}

Sometimes, protocols differ only very little. In that case it can be
convenient to write only one protocol and use *protocol arguments* for
the difference. For example a motor controller for the 3 axes X, Y, Z
requires three protocols to set a position.

    moveX { out "X GOTO %d"; }
    moveY { out "Y GOTO %d"; }
    moveZ { out "Z GOTO %d"; }

It also needs three versions of any other protocol. That means basically
writing everything three times. To make this easier, *protocol
arguments* can be used:

    move { out "\$1 GOTO %d"; }

Now the same protocol can be used in the `OUT` link of three different
records as `move(X)`, `move(Y)` and `move(Z)`.

Up to 9 parameters can be specified in parentheses, separated by comma.
In the protocol, they are referenced as `$1` \... `$9` outside quotes or
`\$1` \... `\$9` within quotes. The parameter `$0` resolves to the
protocol name.

::: new
To make links more readable, one space is allowed before and after each
comma and the enclosing parentheses. This space is not part of the
parameter string. Any additional space is part of the parameter.

If a parameter contains matching pairs of parentheses, these and all
commas inside are part of the parameter. This allows to pass parameter
strings like `(1,2)` easily without much escaping.

Unmatched parentheses must be escaped with double backslash `\\` as well
as must be commas outside pairs of parentheses. Double backslash is
necessary because one backslash is already consumed by the db file
parser. To pass a literal backslash in a parameter string use 4
backslashes `\\\\`.
:::

Note that macros can be used in parameters. That makes it possible to
pass part of the record name to the protocol to be used in
[redirections](#formats.html__redirection).

Example:

    record(ai, "$(PREFIX)recX5") {
        field(DTYP, "stream")
        field(INP,  "@$(PROTOCOLFILE) read(5, X\\,Y $(PREFIX)) $(PORT)")
    }
    record(ai, "$(PREFIX)recY5") {}

    read { out 0x8$1 "READ \$2"; in "%f,%(\$3recY\$1)f" }

The protocol resolves to:

    read { out 0x85 "READ X,Y"; in "%f,%($(PREFIX)recY5)f" }

Here `$(PREFIX)` is replaced with its macro value. But be aware that the
macro is actually replaced before the link is parsed so that macro
values containing comma or parentheses may have unintended effects.

[]{#protocol.html__usrvar}

### User variables {#protocol.html__user-variables}

User defined variables are just a means to save some typing. Once set, a
user variable can be referenced later in the protocol.

    f = "FREQ";     # sets f to "FREQ" (including the quotes)
    f1 = $f " %f";  # sets f1 to "FREQ %f"

    getFrequency {
        out $f "?"; # same as: out "FREQ?"; 
        in $f1;     # same as: in "FREQ %f"; 
    }

    setFrequency {
        out $f1;    # same as: out "FREQ %f"; 
    }

[]{#protocol.html__except}

## 6. Exception Handlers {#protocol.html__exception-handlers}

When an error happens, an exception handler may be called. Exception
handlers are a kind of sub-protocols in a protocol. They consist of the
same set of commands and are intended to reset the device or to finish
the protocol cleanly in case of communication problems. Like variables,
exception handlers can be defined globally or locally. Globally defined
handlers are used for all following protocols unless overwritten by a
local handler. There is a fixed set of exception handler names starting
with `@`.

`@mismatch`
:   Called when input does not match in an `in` command.\
    It means that the device has sent something else than what the
    protocol expected. If the handler starts with an `in` command, then
    this command reparses the old input from the unsuccessful `in`.
    Error messages from the unsuccessful `in` are suppressed.
    Nevertheless, the record will end up in `INVALID/CALC` state (see
    chapter [Record Processing](#processing.html__proc)).

`@writetimeout`
:   Called when a write timeout occurred in an `out` command.\
    It means that output cannot be written to the device. Note that
    `out` commands in the handler are also likely to fail in this case.

`@replytimeout`
:   Called when a reply timeout occurred in an `in` command.\
    It means that the device does not send any data. Note that `in`
    commands in the handler are also likely to fail in this case.

`@readtimeout`
:   Called when a read timeout occurred in an `in` command.\
    It means that the device stopped sending data unexpectedly after
    sending at least one byte.

`@init`
:   Not really an exception but formally specified in the same syntax.
    This handler can be used to initialize an output record with a value
    read from the device. See also chapter [Record
    Processing](#processing.html__init).

Example:

    setPosition {
        out "POS %f";
        @init { out "POS?"; in "POS %f"; }
    }    

After executing the exception handler, the protocol terminates. If any
exception occurs within an exception handler, no other handler is called
but the protocol terminates immediately. An exception handler uses all
[system variable](#protocol.html__sysvar) settings from the protocol in
which the exception occurred.

::: {#recordinterface.html}
# Record API {#recordinterface.html__record-api}

[]{#recordinterface.html__theory}

## Theory of Operation {#recordinterface.html__theory-of-operation}

*StreamDevice* implements the generic part of an EPICS device support.
However it cannot know the internals of a specific record type, such as
the .VAL or .RVAL fields or the .INP or .OUT links. It can only access a
record as dbCommon. Thus it is necessary to write an interface for each
record type which takes care of these details.

A record interface consists of three functions, `readData()` and
`writeData()` and `initRecord()`.

The record interface also implements the device support structure for
this record type. Most of its functions will be generic *StreamDevice*
functions. The exception is `initRecord()`.

The name of the device support structure must have the form
`dev``recordtype`{.variable}`Stream` and the name of the record
interface source code file must be
`dev``recordtype`{.variable}`Stream.c` to work seamlessly with the build
system implemented in the Makefile of *StreamDevice*.

Finally add `recordtype`{.variable} to the `RECORDTYPES` variable in the
file src/CONFIG_STREAM and rebuild.

[]{#recordinterface.html__headers}

Headers to Include

A record interface typically `#include`s the header file for the
supported record type, `"``recordtype`{.variable}`Record.h"` and
`"devStream.h"`. For many record interfaces this is sufficient, but
sometimes additional header files may be needed.

[]{#recordinterface.html__functions}

Functions to Implement

A record interface has to implement three functions:

::: indent
` static long readData(dbCommonÂ *record, format_tÂ *format); `
:::

::: indent
` static long writeData(dbCommonÂ *record, format_tÂ *format); `
:::

::: indent
` static long initRecord(dbCommonÂ *record); `
:::

#### writeData {#recordinterface.html__writedata}

The function `writeData()` is called whenever a
[protocol](#protocol.html__proto) needs to handle a prining [format
converter](#formats.html) (without
[redirection](#formats.html__redirection)), typically in an `out`
command. It is also possible that `writeData()` is called for an input
record, e.g. when the [`=`Â flag](#formats.html__syntax) is used in an
`in` command. Thus implement this function for input records as well.

The functions is called with a `dbCommon *record` argument, which the
function should cast to the specific record type to get access to the
record specific fields, in particular .VAL and .RVAL.

The second argument, `format_tÂ *format`, contains information about the
format converter. The only field of interest in this argument is
`format->type` which specifies the data type of the format conversion.
Its value is one of `DBF_ULONG`, `DBF_ULONG`, `DBF_ENUM`, `DBF_DOUBLE`,
or `DBF_STRING`.

The `writeData()` function may access different fields depending on
`format->type`, e.g. .VAL for `DBF_DOUBLE` but .RVAL for `DBF_LONG`. It
also may interpret the fields in a different way, e.g. cast to `long`
for `DBF_LONG` but to `unsigned long` for `DBF_ULONG`. This is typically
done with a `switch(format->type)` statement.

The function may refuse to handle `format->type` values that make no
sense for the record type, e.g. `DBF_STRING` for a record type that
cannot handle strings. In that case the function should return `ERROR`.
It is a good idea to return `ERROR` in the `default` part of the
`switch` statement.

*StreamDevice* provides a function to output a value from the record:

::: indent
` long streamPrintf(dbCommonÂ *record, format_tÂ *format, ...); `
:::

Once the correct record field and type cast has been chosen, the
`writeData()` function calls
`return streamPrintf(record, format, value)` where the type of value
should match `field->type` (`long`, `unsigned long`, `double`, or
`char*`), returning the result of that call.

**Example:**

    static long writeData(dbCommon *record, format_t *format)
    {
        recordtypeRecord *rec = (recordtypeRecord *)record;

        switch (format->type)
        {
            case DBF_ULONG:
            case DBF_ENUM:
                return streamPrintf(record, format, (unsigned long)rec->rval);
            case DBF_LONG:
                return streamPrintf(record, format, (long)rec->rval);
            case DBF_DOUBLE:
                return streamPrintf(record, format, rec->val);
            default:
                return ERROR;
        }
    }

#### readData {#recordinterface.html__readdata}

The arguments of this function are the same as for `writeData()`. But
this function stores a value into record fields depending on
`format->type`.

*StreamDevice* provides two functions to receive a value;

::: indent
` ssize_t streamScanf(dbCommonÂ *record, format_tÂ *format, void*Â value); `
:::

::: indent
` ssize_t streamScanfN(dbCommonÂ *record, format_tÂ *format, void*Â value, size_tÂ maxStringSize); `
:::

The argument `value` is a pointer to the variable where the value is to
be stored. Its type must match `field->type` (`long*`, `unsigned long*`,
`double*`, or `char*`).

The `streamScanfN()` function is meant for strings and gets the
additional argument `maxStringSize` to specify the size of the string
buffer.

The `streamScanf()` function is actually a macro calling
`streamScanfN()` with `MAX_STRING_SIZE` (=40) for the last argument. For
`field->type` values other than `DBF_STRING`, this argument is ignored.

In case of strings, these functions return the number of characters
actually stored (which may be less than `maxStringSize`). Some record
types may want to store this value into a field of the record.

The functions return `ERROR` on failure. In this case the `readData()`
function should return `ERROR` as well. Otherwise the function should
store the value received into the appropriate record field.

If `record->pact` is `true`, the function should now return `OK` or
`DO_NOT_CONVERT` (=2), depending on wheter conversion from .RVAL to .VAL
should be left to the record or not.

If `record->pact` is `false`, the record is curretly executing the
`@init` handler. This typically only affects output records. As the
record is not processed by EPICS at this time, changes in fields would
not trigger monitor updates.

Also the record will not convert .RVAL to .VAL in this case, thus the
`readData()` function should now convert .RVAL to .VAL as usually done
by the record.

In order to make monitors work properly, the `readData()` function
should then first call `recGblResetAlarms()` and then call
`db_post_events()` as needed. Usually the code from the record support
function `monitor()` needs to be copied. Unfortunately the `monitor()`
function of the record cannot be called directly because it is `static`.

**Example:**

    static long readData(dbCommon *record, format_t *format)
    {
        recordtypeRecord *rec = (recordtypeRecord *)record;
        unsigned long rval;
        unsigned short monitor_mask;

        switch (format->type)
        {
            case DBF_ULONG:
            case DBF_LONG:
            case DBF_ENUM:
                if (streamScanf(record, format, &rval) == ERROR) return ERROR;
                rec->rval = rval;
                if (record->pact) return OK;
                /* emulate convertion to val */
                rec->val = rval * rec->eslo + rec->eoff;
                break;
            case DBF_DOUBLE:
                if (streamScanf(record, format, &rec->val) == ERROR) return ERROR;
                break;
                if (record->pact) return DO_NOT_CONVERT;
            default:
                return ERROR;
        }
        /* In @init handler, no processing, enforce monitor updates. */
        monitor_mask = recGblResetAlarms(record);
        if (rec->oraw != rec->rval)
        {
            db_post_events(record, &rec->rval, monitor_mask | DBE_VALUE | DBE_LOG);
            rec->oraw = rec->rval;
        }
        if (!(fabs(rec->mlst - rec->val) <= rec->mdel))
        {
            monitor_mask |= DBE_VALUE;
            ao->mlst = rec->val;
        }
        if (!(fabs(rec->alst - rec->val) <= rec->adel))
        {
            monitor_mask |= DBE_VALUE;
            ao->alst = rec->val;
        }
        if (monitor_mask)
            db_post_events(record, &rec->val, monitor_mask);
        return OK;
    }

#### initRecord {#recordinterface.html__initrecord}

The main purpose of this function is to pass the .INP or .OUT link to
*StreamDevice* for parsing and to make the two functions `readData` and
`writeData` known. Often the only thing the `initRecord()` function does
is to call `streamInitRecord()` and return its result.

::: indent
` long streamInitRecord(dbCommonÂ *record, const struct linkÂ *ioLink, streamIoFunctionÂ readData, streamIoFunctionÂ writeData); `
:::

    static long initRecord(dbCommon *record)
    {
        recordtypeRecord *rec = (recordtypeRecord *)record;

        return streamInitRecord(record, &rec->out, readData, writeData);
    }

### Device Support Structure {#recordinterface.html__device-support-structure}

For most record types the device support structure contains 5 functions,
`report`, `init`, `init_record`, `get_ioint_info`, and `read` or
`write`. Few other record typess, for examle ai and ao may have
additional functions. For most of these functions simply pass one of the
provided *StreamDevice* functions `streamReport`, `streamInit`,
`streamGetIoInitInfo`, and `streamRead` or `streamWrite`. Only for
`init_record` pass your own `initRecord` function. Then export the
structure.

    struct {
        long number;
        DEVSUPFUN report;
        DEVSUPFUN init;
        DEVSUPFUN init_record;
        DEVSUPFUN get_ioint_info;
        DEVSUPFUN write;
    } devrecordtypeStream = {
        5,
        streamReport,
        streamInit,
        initRecord,
        streamGetIointInfo,
        streamWrite
    };

    epicsExportAddress(dset,devrecordtypeStream);

            return (*pscalcoutDSET->init_record)(pcalc);
        }
```

## Normal Operation {#scalcout.html__normal-operation}

Different record fields are used for output and input. The variable
*`x`* stands for the written or read value.

DOUBLE format (e.g. `%f`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=OVAL`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*\
    Note that the record calculates `OVAL` from `CALC` or `OCAL`
    depending on `DOPT`.

LONG format (e.g. `%i`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=int(OVAL)`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*\

ENUM format (e.g. `%{`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=int(OVAL)`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*\

STRING format (e.g. `%s`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=OSV`\
    [Input:]{.underline} `SVAL=`*`x`*\

For scalcout records, it is probably more useful to access fields `A` to
`L` and `AA` to `LL` directly (e.g. `"%(A)f"` or `"%(BB)s"`). However,
even if `OVAL` is not used, it is calculated by the record. Thus, `CALC`
must always contain a valid expression (e.g. `"0"`).

## Initialization {#scalcout.html__initialization}

During [initialization](#processing.html__init), the `@init` handler is
executed, if present. All format converters work like in normal
operation.

# Setup {#setup.html__setup}

[]{#setup.html__pre}

## 1. Prerequisites {#setup.html__prerequisites}

*StreamDevice* works with [EPICS
base](https://epics.anl.gov/base/index.php) versions from R3.14.6 on,
tested up to 7.0.3. It also works (with limitations) with older
[R3.13](https://epics.anl.gov/base/R3-13.php) versions from R3.13.7 on.
How to use *StreamDevice* with EPICS R3.13 is described on a [separate
page](#epics3_13.html).

Download and build the EPICS version of your choice first before
continuing.

### Fix required for base R3.14.8.2 and earlier on Windows {#setup.html__fix-required-for-base-r3.14.8.2-and-earlier-on-windows}

Up to release R3.14.8.2, a fix in EPICS base is required to build
*StreamDevice* on Windows (not cygwin). Add the following line to
[src/iocsh/iocsh.h]{.kbd} and rebuild base.

    epicsShareFunc int epicsShareAPI iocshCmd(const char *command);

### Downloading *StreamDevice* {#setup.html__downloading-streamdevice}

The latest version of StreamDevice can be found on github:
<https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/StreamDevice>. Either download
a [zip
file](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/StreamDevice/archive/master.zip%0A)
or clone the git repo:

    git clone https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/StreamDevice.git

### Configuration {#setup.html__configuration}

*StreamDevice* now comes with a standard [configure]{.kbd} directory.
~~But it can still be built in an external *\<top\>* directory as in
previous versions. It will automatically detect *\<top\>* locations from
the presence of [../configure]{.kbd} or [../config]{.kbd} directories.~~
Using an upper level [../configure]{.kbd} is no longer supported due to
compatibility issues with *SynApps*.

Edit the [configure/RELEASE]{.kbd} file to specify the install location
of EPICS base and of additional software modules or add a
[configure/RELEASE.local]{.kbd} file to overwrite, for example:

    EPICS_BASE=/home/epics/base-3.16.1

#### Support for *asynDriver* {#setup.html__support-for-asyndriver}

You most probably want to have *asynDriver* support included, because
that is the standard way for *StreamDevice* to talk to hardware. First
get and install
[*asynDriver*](https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/) version
4-3 or higher before you build *StreamDevice*. I have tested
*StreamDevice* with *asynDriver* versions up to 4-30. Make sure that the
*asyn* library can be found by adding the path to the *\<top\>*
directory of your *asyn* installation to the [configure/RELEASE]{.kbd}
file:

    ASYN=/home/epics/asyn4-30

#### Support for *sCalcout* record {#setup.html__support-for-scalcout-record}

The
[*sCalcout*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epics-modules/calc/R3-6-1/documentation/sCalcoutRecord.html)
record is part of [*synApps*](https://www.aps.anl.gov/BCDA/synApps). If
*streamDevice* should be built with support for this record, you have to
install at least the [*calc*
module](https://epics.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/calc/calc.html) from
*SynApps* first. Add references to the [RELEASE]{.kbd} file as shown
here:

    CALC=/home/epics/synApps/calc-R3-6-1

Up to *calc* release R2-6 (*synApps* release R5_1), the *sCalcout*
record needs a fix. (See separate [*scalcout* page](#scalcout.html).)
And the *calc* module had dependencies on other *SynApps* modules.
Release R2-8 or newer is recommended.

Support for the *sCalcout* is optional. *StreamDevice* works as well
without *sCalcout* or *SynApps*.

#### Support for regular expression matching {#setup.html__support-for-regular-expression-matching}

If you want to enable regular expression matching, you need the *PCRE*
package. For most Linux systems, it is already installed. In that case
tell *StreamDevice* the locations of the *PCRE* header file and library.
However, the pre-installed package can only by used for the host
architecture. Thus, add them not to [RELEASE]{.kbd} but to
[RELEASE.Common.linux-x86]{.kbd} (if linux-x86 is your EPICS_HOST_ARCH).
Be aware that different Linux distributions may locate the files in
different directories.

    PCRE_INCLUDE=/usr/include/pcre
    PCRE_LIB=/usr/lib

For 64 bit installations, the path to the library may be different:

    PCRE_INCLUDE=/usr/include/pcre
    PCRE_LIB=/usr/lib64

A pre-compiled Windows version of *PCRE* is available at
[sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/pcre/7.0/pcre-7.0.exe/download)

If you want to have *PCRE* support on platforms that don\'t support it
natively, e.g. vxWorks, it is probably the easiest to build *PCRE* as an
EPICS module.

#### Building the *PCRE* package as an EPICS module {#setup.html__building-the-pcre-package-as-an-epics-module}

1.  Download the *PCRE* package from
    [www.pcre.org](https://www.pcre.org).
2.  Extract the *PCRE* package in the [\<top\>]{.kbd} directory of
    *StreamDevice* or create a separate [\<top\>]{.kbd} location using
    `makeBaseApp.pl`.
3.  Download this
    [Makefile](http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/pcre/Makefile)
    and this
    [fixforvxworks.pl](http://epics.web.psi.ch/software/streamdevice/pcre/fixforvxworks.pl)
    script and save them to the extracted pcre directory.
4.  Change into the pcre direcrory and run `perl fixforvxworks.pl`
5.  Run `make` (or `gmake`)

Define the location of the pcre [\<top\>]{.kbd} in the RELEASE file for
*StreamDevice*.

    PCRE=/home/epics/pcre

Regular expressions are optional. If you don\'t want them, you don\'t
need this.

[]{#setup.html__lib}

## 2. Building *StreamDevice* {#setup.html__building-streamdevice}

Go to the *StreamDevice* directory and run `make` (or `gmake`). This
will create and install the *stream* library and the [stream.dbd]{.kbd}
file and an example IOC application.

To use *StreamDevice*, your own application must be built with the
*stream* and *asyn* (and optionally *pcre*) libraries and must load
[asyn.dbd]{.kbd} and [stream.dbd]{.kbd}.

Include the following lines in your application [Makefile]{.kbd}:

    PROD_LIBS += stream
    PROD_LIBS += asyn
    PROD_LIBS += pcre

Include the following lines in your [xxxAppInclude.dbd]{.kbd} file to
use *stream* and *asyn* with serial lines, IP sockets, and vxi11 (\"GPIB
over ethernet\") support.

    include "base.dbd"
    include "stream.dbd"
    include "asyn.dbd"
    registrar(drvAsynIPPortRegisterCommands)
    registrar(drvAsynSerialPortRegisterCommands)
    registrar(vxi11RegisterCommands)

You can find an example application in the [streamApp]{.kbd}
subdirectory.

[]{#setup.html__sta}

## 3. The Startup Script {#setup.html__the-startup-script}

*StreamDevice* is based on [*protocol files*](#protocol.html). To tell
*StreamDevice* where to search for protocol files, set the environment
variable `STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH` to a list of directories to search. On
Unix and vxWorks systems, directories are separated by `:`, on Windows
systems by `;`. The default value is `STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH=.`, i.e. the
current directory.

Also configure the buses (in *asynDriver* terms: ports) you want to use
with *StreamDevice*. You can give the buses any name you want, like
[COM1]{.kbd} or [socket]{.kbd}, but I recommend to use names related to
the connected device.

### Example: {#setup.html__example}

A device with serial communication (9600 baud, 8N1, no flow control) is
connected to [/dev/ttyS1]{.kbd}. The name of the device shall be `PS1`.
Protocol files are either in the current working directory or in the
[../protocols]{.kbd} directory.

Then the startup script may look like this:

    epicsEnvSet ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", ".:../protocols")

    drvAsynSerialPortConfigure ("PS1","/dev/ttyS1")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "baud", "9600")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "bits", "8")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "parity", "none")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "stop", "1")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "clocal", "Y")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "crtscts", "N")

All above options are the defaults. Thus their usage in optional in this
case.

If the device uses hardware flow control, change the last two lines to:

    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "clocal", "N")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "crtscts", "Y")

Newer versions of *asyn* also support software flow control
(CTRL-S,CTRL-Q). If the device uses this, you may want to set:

    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "ixon", "Y")
    asynSetOption ("PS1", 0, "ixany", "Y")

If the device was instead connected via telnet-style TCP/IP at address
192.168.164.10 on port 23, the startup script would contain:

    epicsEnvSet ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", ".:../protocols")

    drvAsynIPPortConfigure ("PS1", "192.168.164.10:23")

With a VXI11 (GPIB via TCP/IP) connection, e.g. a HP E2050A on IP
address 192.168.164.10, it would look like this:

    epicsEnvSet ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", ".:../protocols")

    vxi11Configure ("PS1","192.168.164.10",1,1000,"hpib")

[]{#setup.html__pro}

## 4. The Protocol File {#setup.html__the-protocol-file}

For each different type of hardware, create a protocol file which
defines protocols for all needed functions of the device. The file name
is arbitrary, but I recommend that it contains the device type. It must
not contain spaces and should be short. During `iocInit`, *streamDevice*
loads and parses the required protocol files. If the files contain
errors, they are printed on the IOC shell. Put the protocol file in one
of the directories listed in `STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH`.

### Example: {#setup.html__example-1}

`PS1` is an *ExamplePS* power supply. It communicates via ASCII strings
which are terminated by \<carriageÂ return\> \<lineÂ feed\> (ASCII codes
13, 10). The output current can be set by sending a string like
`"CURRENT 5.13"`. When asked with the string `"CURRENT?"`, the device
returns the last set value in a string like `"CURRENT 5.13 A"`.

Normally, an analog output record should write its value to the device.
But during startup, the record should be initialized from the the
device. The protocol file [ExamplePS.proto]{.kbd} defines the protocols
`getCurrent` and `setCurrent`.

    Terminator = CR LF;

    getCurent {
            out "CURRENT?";
            in "CURRENT %f A";
        }

    setCurrent {
        out "CURRENT %.2f";
        @init {
            getCurent;
        }
    }

[]{#setup.html__reload}

### Reloading the Protocol File {#setup.html__reloading-the-protocol-file}

During development, the protocol files might change frequently. To
prevent restarting the IOC all the time, it is possible to reload the
protocol file of one or all records with the shell function
`streamReload("``record`{.variable}`")`. If `"``record`{.variable}`"` is
not given [or empty]{.new}, all records using *StreamDevice* reload
their protocols. [In EPICS 3.14 or higher, `record`{.variable} can be a
glob pattern.]{.new}

Furthermore, the `streamReloadSub` function can be used with a
subroutine record to reload all protocols.

Reloading the protocol file aborts currently running protocols. This
might set `SEVR=INVALID` and `STAT=UDF`. If a record can\'t reload its
protocol file (e.g. because of a syntax error), it stays `INVALID`/`UDF`
until a valid protocol is loaded.

[Reloading triggers an `@init` [handler](#protocol.html__except).]{.new}
See the [next chapter](#protocol.html) for protocol files in depth.

[]{#setup.html__debug}

## 5. Debug and Error Messages {#setup.html__debug-and-error-messages}

Generation of debug and error messages is controlled with two shell
variables, `streamDebug` and `streamError`. Setting those variables to 1
(actually to any number but 0) enables the messages. Per default debug
messages are switched off and error messages are switched on. Errors
occuring while loading protocol files are always shown.

Warning: Enabling debug messages can create a lot of output! At the
moment, there is no way to set filters on debug or error messages.

Debug output can be redirected to a file with the command
`streamSetLogfile("``filename`{.variable}`")`. When called without a
filename, debug output is directed back to the console.

By default the debug/error output is set to be colored if the terminal
allows it but this can be set to always colored or never colored by
setting `streamDebugColored` to 1 or 0 respectively.

Error and debug messages are prefixed with a time stamp unless the
variable `streamMsgTimeStamped` is set to 0.

When a device is disconnected StreamDevice can produce many repeated
timeout messages. To reduce this logging you can set
`streamErrorDeadTime` to an integer number of seconds. When this is set
repeated timeout messages will not be printed in the specified dead time
after the last message. The default dead time is 0, resulting in every
message being printed.

### Example (vxWorks): {#setup.html__example-vxworks}

    streamError=1
    streamDebug=1
    streamDebugColored=1
    streamErrorDeadTime=30
    streamMsgTimeStamped=1
    streamSetLogfile("logfile.txt")

### Example (iocsh): {#setup.html__example-iocsh}

    var streamError 1
    var streamDebug 1
    var streamDebugColored 1
    var streamErrorDeadTime 30
    var streamMsgTimeStamped 1
    streamSetLogfile("logfile.txt")

[]{#setup.html__rec}

## 6. Configuring the Records {#setup.html__configuring-the-records}

To tell a record to use *StreamDevice*, set its `DTYP` field to
`"stream"`.

The `INP` or `OUT` link has the form
`"@``filenameÂ protocol`{.variable}`[(``arg1`{.variable}`,``arg2`{.variable}`,...)]Â busÂ [``address`{.variable}`Â [``parameters`{.variable}`]]"`.

(Elements in `[]` are optional. Do not type the `[]`).

Here, `filename`{.variable} is the name of the protocol file and
`protocol`{.variable} is the name of a protocol defined in this file.
(See the [next chapter](#protocol.html).)

If the protocol requires [arguments](#protocol.html__argvar), specify
them enclosed in parentheses:
`protocol`{.variable}`(``arg1,arg2,...`{.variable}`)`. [Spaces in the
argument list are now allowed. The first space before and after an
argument is ignored. Further spaces are considered part of the
argument.]{.new}

The communication channel is specified with `bus`{.variable} (aka
*asynDriver* \"port\") and `addr`{.variable}. If the bus does not have
addresses, `addr`{.variable} may be skipped. Optional
`parameters`{.variable} are passed to the bus driver. (At the moment, no
bus driver supports parameters.)

### Example: {#setup.html__example-2}

Create an input record to read and an output record to set the current
of `PS1`. Use protocols *getCurrent* and *setCurrent* from file
*ExamplePS.proto*. The bus is called *PS1* like the device.

    record (ai, "PS1:I-get")
    {
        field (DESC, "Read current of PS1")
        field (DTYP, "stream")
        field (INP,  "@ExamplePS.proto getCurrent PS1")
        field (EGU,  "A")
        field (PREC, "2")
        field (LOPR, "0")
        field (HOPR, "60")
        field (PINI, "YES")
        field (SCAN, "10 second")
    }
    record (ao, "PS1:I-set")
    {
        field (DESC, "Set current of PS1")
        field (DTYP, "stream")
        field (OUT,  "@ExamplePS.proto setCurrent PS1")
        field (EGU,  "A")
        field (PREC, "2")
        field (DRVL, "0")
        field (DRVH, "60")
        field (LOPR, "0")
        field (HOPR, "60")
    }

## I have many almost identical protocols {#tipsandtricks.html__i-have-many-almost-identical-protocols}

You can give [arguments](#protocol.html__argvar) to a protocol. In the
`INP` or `OUT` link, write:

` field (OUT, "@protocolfile protocol(arg1,arg2,arg3) bus") `

In the protocol, reference arguments as `$1 $2 $3` or inside strings as
`"\$1 \$2 \$3"`.

` moveaxis {out "move\$1 %.6f";}`\
`field (OUT, "@motor.proto moveaxis(X) motor1") `

` readpressure {out 0x02 0x00 $1; in 0x82 0x00 $1 "%2r";}`\

[]{#tipsandtricks.html__iointr}

## I have a device that sends unsolicited data {#tipsandtricks.html__i-have-a-device-that-sends-unsolicited-data}

` read {in "new value = %f";} `

` record (ai, "$(RECORD)") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\

Use as many `in` commands as you get input lines.

` read_value {in "Here is the value:"; in "%f";} `

[]{#tipsandtricks.html__writemany}

## I need to write more than one value in one message {#tipsandtricks.html__i-need-to-write-more-than-one-value-in-one-message}

There is more than one solution to this problem. Different approaches
have different requirements.

### A) All values have the same type and are separated by the same string {#tipsandtricks.html__a-all-values-have-the-same-type-and-are-separated-by-the-same-string}

Use array records (e.g. [waveform](#waveform.html), [aao](#aao.html)).

` array_out {separator=", "; out "an array: (%.2f)";} `

The format `%.2f` is repeated for each element of the array. All
elements are separated by `", "`.\
Output will look like this:

    an array: (3.14, 17.30, -12.34)

### B) We have up to 12 numeric values {#tipsandtricks.html__b-we-have-up-to-12-numeric-values}

Use a [calcout](#calcout.html) record and [redirection to
fields](#formats.html__redirection).

` write_ABC {out "A=%(A).2f B=%(B).6f C=%(C).0f";} `

You must specify a valid expression in the `CALC` field even if you
don\'t use it.

` record (calcout, "$(RECORD)") {`\
`Â Â field (INPA, "$(A_RECORD)")`\
`Â Â field (INPB, "$(B_RECORD)")`\
`Â Â field (INPC, "$(C_RECORD)")`\
`Â Â field (CALC, "0")`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (OUT, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto write_ABC $(BUS)")`\
`} `

### C) Values are in other records on the same IOC {#tipsandtricks.html__c-values-are-in-other-records-on-the-same-ioc}

Use [redirection to records](#formats.html__redirection).

` acquire {out 'ACQUIRE "%(\$1:directory)s/%s",%(\$1:time).3f;';} `

You can specify a record name or record.FIELD in parentheses directly
after the `%`. To avoid plain record names in protocol files use
[protocol arguments](#protocol.html__argvar) like `\$1`. In the link,
specify the record name or just the basename of the other records
(device name) in parentheses.

` record (stringout, "$(DEVICE):getimage") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (OUT, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto acquire($(DEVICE)) $(BUS)")`\
`} `

[]{#tipsandtricks.html__readmany}

## I need to read more than one value from one message {#tipsandtricks.html__i-need-to-read-more-than-one-value-from-one-message}

Again, there is more than one solution to this problem.

### A) All values have the same type and are separated by the same string {#tipsandtricks.html__a-all-values-have-the-same-type-and-are-separated-by-the-same-string-1}

Use array records (e.g. [waveform](#waveform.html), [aai](#aai.html)).\

` array_in {separator=","; in "array = (%f)";} `

The format `%f` is repeated for each element of the array. A `","` is
expected beween element.\
Input may look like this:

    array = (3.14, 17.30, -12.34)

### B) The message and the values in it can be filtered easily {#tipsandtricks.html__b-the-message-and-the-values-in-it-can-be-filtered-easily}

Use [`I/O Intr` processing](#processing.html__iointr) and [value
skipping](#formats.html__syntax) (`%*`)\

` read_A {out "GET A,B"; in "A=%f, B=%*f";}`\
`read_B {in "A=%*f, B=%f";} `

` record (ai, "$(DEVICE):A") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (INP, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto read_A $(BUS)")`\
`Â Â field (SCAN, "1 second")`\
`}`\
`record (ai, "$(DEVICE):B") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (INP, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto read_B $(BUS)")`\
`Â Â field (SCAN, "I/O Intr")`\
`} `

Record A actively requests values every second. The reply contains
values A and B. Record A filters only value A from the input and ignores
value B by using the `*` flag. Nevertheless, a complete syntax check is
performed: B must be a valid floating point number. Record B is
`I/O Intr` and gets (a copy of) any input, including input that was
directed to record A. If it finds a matching string it ignores value A,
reads value B and then processes. Any non-matching input is ignored by
record B.

### C) Values should be stored in other records on the same IOC {#tipsandtricks.html__c-values-should-be-stored-in-other-records-on-the-same-ioc}

Use [redirection to records](#formats.html__redirection). To avoid
record names in protocol files, use [protocol
arguments](#protocol.html__argvar).

` read_AB {out "GET A,B"; in "A=%f, B=%(\$1)f";} `

` record (ai, "$(DEVICE):A") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (INP, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto read_AB($(DEVICE):B) $(BUS)")`\
`Â Â field (SCAN, "1 second")`\
`}`\
`record (ai, "$(DEVICE):B") {`\
`} `

Whenever record A reads input, it stores the first value in its own VAL
field as usual and the second in the VAL field of record B. Because the
VAL field of record B has the PP attribute, this automatically processes
record B.

[]{#tipsandtricks.html__mixed}

## I have a device that sends mixed data types: numbers or strings {#tipsandtricks.html__i-have-a-device-that-sends-mixed-data-types-numbers-or-strings}

Use a `@mismatch` [exception handler](#protocol.html__except) and
[redirection to records](#formats.html__redirection). To avoid record
names in protocol files, use [protocol
arguments](#protocol.html__argvar).

### Example {#tipsandtricks.html__example}

When asked \"`CURRENT?`\", the device send something like
\"`CURRENTÂ 3.24Â A`\" or a message like \"`deviceÂ switchedÂ off`\".

` read_current {out "CURRENT?"; in "CURRENT %f A"; @mismatch {in "%(\$1)39c";}} `

` record (ai, "$(DEVICE):readcurrent") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (INP, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto read_current($(DEVICE):message) $(BUS)")`\
`}`\
`record (stringin, "$(DEVICE):message") {`\
`} `

After [processing](#processing.html__proc) the readcurrent record, you
can see from SEVR/STAT if the read was successful or not. With some more
records, you can clean the message record if SEVR is not INVALID.

` record (calcout, "$(DEVICE):clean_1") {`\
`Â Â field (INPA, "$(DEVICE):readcurrent.SEVR CP")`\
`Â Â field (CALC, "A#3")`\
`Â Â field (OOPT, "When Non-zero")`\
`Â Â field (OUT, "$(DEVICE):clean_2.PROC")`\
`}`\
`record (stringout, "$(DEVICE):clean_2") {`\
`Â Â field (VAL, "OK")`\
`Â Â field (OUT, "$(DEVICE):message PP")`\
`}`\
[]{#tipsandtricks.html__web}

## I need to read a web page {#tipsandtricks.html__i-need-to-read-a-web-page}

First you have to send a correctly formatted HTML header for a GET
request. Note that this header must contain the full URL like
\"http://server/page\" and must be terminated with [two]{.underline} CR
LF sequences (`"\r\n\r\n"` or `CR LF CR LF`). The server should be the
same as in the [`drvAsynIPPortConfigure`](#setup.html__sta) command (if
not using a http proxy). The web page you get often contains much more
information than you need. [Regular expressions](#formats.html__regex)
are great to find what you are looking for.

### Example 1 {#tipsandtricks.html__example-1}

Read the title of a web page.

` get_title {`\
`Â Â extrainput = ignore;`\
`Â Â replyTimeout = 1000;`\
`Â Â out "GET http://\$1\r\n\r\n";`\
`Â Â in "%+.1/(?im)<title>(.*)<\/title>/";`\
`} `

Terminate the request with two carriage return + newlines, either
explicit like here [or]{.underline} using an
[`outTerminator`](#protocol.html__sysvar). The URI (without http:// but
including the web server host name) is passed as
[argument](#protocol.html__argvar) 1 to `\$1` in this example. Note that
web servers may be slow, so allow some
[`replyTimeout`](#protocol.html__argvar).

If you don\'t use an `inTerminator` then the whole page is read as one
\"line\" to the `in` command and can be parsed easily with a regular
expression. We want to see the string between `<title>` and `</title>`,
so we put it into a subexpression in `()` and request the first
subexpression with `.1`. Note that the `/` in the closing tag has be be
escaped to avoid a misinterpretation as the closing `/` of the regular
expression.

The tags may be upper or lower case like `<TITLE>` or `<Title>`, so we
ask for case insensitive matching with `(?i)`.

The string should be terminated with the first closing `</title>`, not
the last one in the file. (There should not be more than one title but
you never know.) Thus we ask not to be greedy with `(?m)`. `(?i)` and
`(?m)` can be combined to `(?im)`. See the PCRE documentation for more
regexp syntax.

The regular expression matcher ignores and discards any content before
the matching section. Content after the match is discarded with
`extrainput = ignore` so that it does not trigger errors reporting
\"surplus input\".

Finally, the title may be too long for the record. The `+` tells the
format matcher not to fail in this case but to truncate the string
instead. You can read the string with a stringin record or for longer
strings with a waveform record with data type CHAR.

` record (stringin, "$(DEVICE):title") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (INP, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto get_title($(PAGE)) $(BUS)")`\
`}`\
`record (waveform, "$(DEVICE):longtitle") {`\
`Â Â field (DTYP, "stream")`\
`Â Â field (INP, "@$(DEVICETYPE).proto get_title($(PAGE)) $(BUS)")`\
`Â Â field (FTVL, "CHAR")`\
`Â Â field (NELM, "100")`\
`}`\

### Example 2 {#tipsandtricks.html__example-2}

Read a number from a web page. First we have to locate the number. For
that we match against any known string right before the number (and
[discard the match](#formats.html__syntax) with `*`). Then we read the
number.

` get_title {`\
`Â Â extrainput = ignore;`\
`Â Â replyTimeout = 1000;`\
`Â Â out "GET http://\$1\r\n\r\n";`\
`Â Â in "%*/Interesting value:/%f more text";`\
`} `

When using `extrainput = ignore;`, it is always a good idea to match a
few bytes after the value, too. This catches errors where loading of the
page is interrupted in the middle of the number. (You don\'t want to
miss the exponent from something like 1.23E-14).

You can read more than one value from a file with successive regular
expressions and [redirections](#formats.html__redirection). But this
only works if the order of the values is predictible. *StreamDevice* is
not an XML parser! It always reads sequentially.

# waveform Records {#waveform.html__waveform-records}

## Normal Operation {#waveform.html__normal-operation}

With waveform records, the format converter is applied to each array
element. Between the elements, a separator is printed or expected as
specified by the `Separator` [variable](#protocol.html__sysvar) in the
protocol. When parsing input, a space as the first character of the
`Separator` matches any number of any whitespace characters.

During input, a maximum of `NELM` elements is read and `NORD` is updated
accordingly. Parsing of elements stops when the separator does not
match, conversion fails, or the end of the input is reached. A minimum
of one element must be available.

During output, the first `NORD` elements are written.

The format data type must be convertible to or from the type specified
in the `FTVL` field. The types `"INT64"` and `"UINT64"` are only
available in EPICS base version 3.16 or higher.

The variable *`x[i]`* stands for one element of the written or read
value.

DOUBLE format (e.g. `%f`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x[i]`*`=double(VAL[i])`\
    `FTVL` can be `"DOUBLE"`, `"FLOAT"`, `"INT64"`, `"UINT64"`,
    `"LONG"`, `"ULONG"`, `"SHORT"`, `"USHORT"`, `"CHAR"`, `"UCHAR"`, or
    `"ENUM"` (which is treated as `"USHORT"`).\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL[i]=FTVL(`*`x[i]`*`)`\
    `FTVL` must be `"FLOAT"` or `"DOUBLE"`

LONG or ENUM format (e.g. `%i` or `%{`):
:   [Output:]{.underline} *`x[i]`*`=long(VAL[i])`\
    `FTVL` can be `"INT64"`, `"UINT64"`, `"LONG"`, `"ULONG"`, `"SHORT"`,
    `"USHORT"`, `"CHAR"`, `"UCHAR"`, or `"ENUM"` (which is treated as
    `"USHORT"`).\
    Signed values are sign-extended to long, unsigned values are
    zero-extended to long before converting them.\
    [Input:]{.underline} `VAL[i]=FTVL(`*`x[i])`*\
    `FTVL` can be `"DOUBLE"`, `"FLOAT"`, `"INT64"`, `"UINT64"`,
    `"LONG"`, `"ULONG"`, `"SHORT"`, `"USHORT"`, `"CHAR"`, `"UCHAR"`, or
    `"ENUM"` (which is treated as `"USHORT"`).\
    The value is truncated to the least significant bytes if `FTVL` has
    a smaller data size than `long`.

STRING format (e.g. `%s`):

:   

    If `FTVL=="STRING"`:
    :   [Output:]{.underline} *`x[i]`*`=VAL[i]`\
        [Input:]{.underline} `VAL[i]=`*`x[i]`*\
        Note that this is an array of strings, not an array of
        characters.

    If `FTVL=="CHAR"` or `FTVL="UCHAR"`:
    :   In this case, the complete waveform is treated as a large single
        string of size `NORD`. No separators are printed or expected.\
        [Output:]{.underline} *`x`*`=range(VAL,0,NORD)`\
        The first `NORD` characters are printed, which might be less
        than `NELM`.\
        [Input:]{.underline} `VAL=`*`x`*`, NORD=length(`*`x`*`)`\
        A maximum of `NELM-1` characters can be read. `NORD` is updated
        to the index of the first of the trailing zeros. Usually, this
        is the same as the string length.

    Other values of `FTVL` are not allowed for this format.

## Initialization {#waveform.html__initialization}

During [initialization](#processing.html__init), the `@init` handler is
executed, if present. All format converters work like in normal
operation.
