Analog Output Record (ao)
=========================

   This record type is normally used to send an analog value to an
   output device, converting it from engineering units into an integer
   value if necessary. The record supports alarm and drive limits,
   rate-of-change limiting, output value integration, linear and
   break-point conversion from engineering units, and graphics and
   control limits.

Record-specific Menus
---------------------

Menu aoOIF
++++++++++

   The OIF field which uses this menu controls whether the record acts
   as an integrator (``Incremental``) or not (``Full``).

      Index Identifier        Choice String
      ===== ================= =============
      0     aoOIF_Full        Full

The following steps are performed in order during record processing.

Fetch Value, Integrate
++++++++++++++++++++++

   The OMSL menu field is used to determine whether the DOL link and OIF
   menu fields should be used during processing or not:

   -  If OMSL is ``supervisory`` the DOL and OIF fields are not used.
      The new output value is taken from the VAL field, which may have
      been set from elsewhere.
   -  If OMSL is ``closed_loop`` the DOL link field is read to obtain a
      value; if OIF is ``Incremental`` and the DOL link was read
      successfully, the record's previous output value PVAL is added to
      it.

Drive Limits
++++++++++++

   The output value is now clipped to the range DRVL to DRVH inclusive,
   provided that DRVH > DRVL. The result is copied into both the VAL and
   PVAL fields.

Limit Rate of Change
++++++++++++++++++++

   If the OROC field is not zero, the VAL field is now adjusted so it is
   no more than OROC different to the previous output value given in
   OVAL. OROC thus determines the maximum change in the output value
   that can occur each time the record gets processed. The result is
   copied into the OVAL field, which is used as the input to the
   following Units Conversion processing stage.

Units Conversion
++++++++++++++++

   ...

   For analog output records that do not use the Soft Channel device
   support routine, the specified conversions (if any) are performed on
   the OVAL field and the resulting value in the RVAL field is sent to
   the address contained in the output link after it is adjusted by the
   values in the AOFF and ASLO fields.

.. _ao-conversion-spec:
Conversion Related Fields and the Conversion Process
----------------------------------------------------

   Except for analog outputs that use Soft Channel device support, the
   LINR field determines if a conversion is performed and which
   conversion algorithm is used to convert OVAL to RVAL.

   The LINR field can specify ``LINEAR`` or ``SLOPE`` for linear
   conversions, ``NO CONVERSION`` for no conversions at all, or the name
   of a breakpoint table such as ``typeKdegC`` for breakpoint
   conversions.

   The EGUF and EGUL fields should be set for ``LINEAR`` conversions,
   and the ESLO and EOFF fields for ``SLOPE`` conversion. Note that none
   of these fields have any significance for records that use the Soft
   Channel device support module.

   EGUF, EGUF
      The user must set these fields when configuring the database for
      records that use ``LINEAR`` conversions. They are used to
      calculate the values for ESLO and EOFF. See Conversion
      Specification for more information on how to calculate these
      fields.

   ESLO, EOFF
      Computed by device support from EGUF and EGUL when LINR specifies
      ``LINEAR``. These values must be supplied by the user when LINR
      specifies ``SLOPE``. Used only when LINR is ``LINEAR`` or
      ``SLOPE``.

   AOFF, ASLO
      These fields are adjustment parameters for the raw output values.
      They are applied to the raw output value after conversion from
      engineering units.

   ROFF
      This field can be used to offset the raw value generated by the
      conversion process, which is needed for some kinds of hardware.

   Conversion proceeds as follows:

   1. If LINR==LINEAR or LINR==SLOPE, then X = (VAL - EOFF) / ESLO, else
   if LINR==NO_CONVERSION, then X = VAL, else X is obtained via
   breakpoint table.
   2. X = (X - AOFF) / ASLO
   3. RVAL = round(X) - ROFF
   To see how the Raw Soft Channel device support routine uses these
   fields, see `"Device Support For Soft
   Records" <#Device-Support-For-Soft-Records>`__ below for more
   information.

Output Specification
--------------------

   The analog output record sends its desired output to the address in
   the OUT field. For analog outputs that write their values to devices,
   the OUT field must specify the address of the I/O card. In addition,
   the DTYP field must contain the name of the device support module. Be
   aware that the address format differs according to the I/O bus used.
   See `Address
   Specification <https://docs.epics-controls.org/en/latest/guides/EPICS_Process_Database_Concepts.html#address-specification>`__
   for information on the format of hardware addresses.

   For soft records the output link can be a database link, a channel
   access link, or a constant value. If the link is a constant, no
   output is sent.

Operator Display Parameters
---------------------------

   These parameters are used to present meaningful data to the operator.
   They display the value and other parameters of the analog output
   either textually or graphically.

   EGU is a string of up to 16 characters describing the units that the
   analog output measures. It is retrieved by the get_units record
   support routine.

   The HOPR and LOPR fields set the upper and lower display limits for
   the VAL, OVAL, PVAL, HIHI, HIGH, LOW, and LOLO fields. Both the
   get_graphic_double and get_control_double record support routines
   retrieve these fields. If these values are defined, they must be in
   the range: DRVL <= LOPR <= HOPR <= DRVH.

   The PREC field determines the floating point precision with which to
   display VAL, OVAL and PVAL. It is used whenever the get_precision
   record support routine is called.

   See `Fields Common to All Record
   Types <dbCommonRecord.html#Operator-Display-Parameters>`__ for more
   on the record name (NAME) and description (DESC) fields.

Alarm Parameters
----------------

   The possible alarm conditions for analog outputs are the SCAN, READ,
   INVALID and limit alarms. The SCAN, READ, and INVALID alarms are
   called by the record or device support routines.

   The limit alarms are configured by the user in the HIHI, LOLO, HIGH,
   and LOW fields, which must be floating-point values. For each of
   these fields, there is a corresponding severity field which can be
   either NO_ALARM, MINOR, or MAJOR.

   See `Invalid Output Action
   Fields <dbCommonOutput.html#Invalid-Output-Action-Fields>`__ for more
   information on the IVOA and IVOV fields.

   `Alarm Fields <dbCommonRecord.html#Alarm-Fields>`__ lists other

Monitor Parameters
      :name: monitor-parameters

   These parameters are used to specify deadbands for monitors on the
   VAL field. The monitors are sent when the value field exceeds the
   last monitored field by the specified deadband. If these fields have
   a value of zero, everytime the value changes, a monitor will be
   triggered; if they have a value of -1, everytime the record is
   processed, monitors are triggered. ADEL is the deadband for archive
   monitors, and MDEL the deadband for all other types of monitors. See
   Monitor Specification for a complete explanation of monitors.

Run-time Parameters
-------------------

   These parameters are used by the run-time code for processing the
   analog output. They are not configurable. They represent the current
   state of the record. The record support routines use some of them for
   more efficient processing.

   The ORAW field is used to decide if monitors should be triggered for
   RVAL when monitors are triggered for VAL. The RBV field is the actual
   read back value obtained from the hardware itself or from the
   associated device driver. It is the responsibility of the device
   support routine to give this field a value.

   ORBV is used to decide if monitors should be triggered for RBV at the
   same time monitors are triggered for changes in VAL.

   The LALM, MLST, and ALST fields are used to implement the hysteresis
   factors for monitor callbacks.

   The INIT field is used to initialize the LBRK field and for
   smoothing.

   The PBRK field contains a pointer to the current breakpoint table (if
   any), and LBRK contains a pointer to the last breakpoint table used.

   The OMOD field indicates whether OVAL differs from VAL. It will be
   different if VAL or OVAL have changed since the last time the record
   was processed, or if VAL has been adjusted by OROC during the current
   processing.

Simulation Mode Parameters
      :name: simulation-mode-parameters

   The following fields are used to operate the record in simulation
   mode.

   If SIMM (fetched through SIML, if populated) is YES, the record is
   put in SIMS severity and the value is written through SIOL, without
   conversion. If SIMM is RAW, the value is converted and RVAL is
   written. SSCN sets a different SCAN mechanism to use in simulation
   mode. SDLY sets a delay (in sec) that is used for asynchronous
   simulation processing.

   See `Output Simulation
   Fields <dbCommonOutput.html#Output-Simulation-Fields>`__ for more
   information on simulation mode and its fields.

Record Support
--------------

Record Support Routines
+++++++++++++++++++++++

   The following are the record support routines that would be of
   interest to an application developer. Other routines are the
   get_units, get_precision, get_graphic_double, and get_control_double
   routines.

   init_record
      ``long init_record(aoRecord *prec, int pass);``

      This routine initializes SIMM if SIML is a constant or creates a
      channel access link if SIML is PV_LINK. If SIOL is PV_LINK a
      channel access link is created.

      This routine next checks to see that device support is available.
      If DOL is a constant, then VAL is initialized with its value and
      UDF is set to FALSE.

      The routine next checks to see if the device support write routine
      is defined. If either device support or the device support write
      routine does not exist, an error message is issued and processing
      is terminated.

      For compatibility with old device supports that don't know EOFF,
      if both EOFF and ESLO have their default value, EOFF is set to
      EGUL.

      If device support includes ``init_record()``, it is called.

      INIT is set TRUE. This causes PBRK, LBRK, and smoothing to be
      re-initialized. If "backwards" linear conversion is requested,
      then VAL is computed from RVAL using the algorithm:

      ::

          VAL = ((RVAL+ROFF) * ASLO + AOFF) * ESLO + EOFF

      and UDF is set to FALSE.

      For breakpoint conversion, a call is made to cvtEngToRawBpt and
      UDF is then set to FALSE. PVAL is set to VAL.

   process
      ``long process(aoRecord *prec);``

      See next section.

   special
      ``long special(DBADDR *paddr, int after);``

      The only special processing for analog output records is
      SPC_LINCONV which is invoked whenever either of the fields LINR,
      EGUF, EGUL or ROFF is changed If the device support routine
      special_linconv exists it is called.

      INIT is set TRUE. This causes PBRK, LBRK, and smoothing to be
      re-initialized.

   get_alarm_double
      ``long get_alarm_double(DBADDR *, struct dbr_alDouble *);``

      Sets the following values:

      ::

          upper_alarm_limit = HIHI
          upper_warning_limit = HIGH
          lower_warning_limit = LOW
          lower_alarm_limit = LOLO

Record Processing
-----------------

   Routine process implements the following algorithm:

   1. Check to see that the appropriate device support module exists. If
   it doesn't, an error message is issued and processing is terminated
   with the PACT field set to TRUE. This ensures that processes will no
   longer be called for this record. Thus error storms will not occur.

   2. Check PACT: If PACT is FALSE call fetch_values and convert which
   perform the following steps:

   -  fetch_values:

      -  if DOL is DB_LINK and OMSL is CLOSED_LOOP then get value from
         DOL
      -  if OIF is INCREMENTAL then set value = value + VAL else value =
         VAL

   -  convert:

      -  If Drive limits are defined force value to be within limits
      -  Set VAL equal to value
      -  Set UDF to FALSE.
      -  If OVAL is undefined set it equal to value
      -  If OROC is defined and not 0 make \|value-OVAL\| <=OROC
      -  Set OVAL equal to value
      -  Compute RVAL from OVAL. using linear or break point table
         conversion. For linear conversions the algorithm is RVAL =
         (OVAL-EOFF)/ESLO.
      -  For break point table conversion a call is made to
         cvtEngToRawBpt.
      -  After that, for all conversion types AOFF, ASLO, and ROFF are
         calculated in, using the formula RVAL = (RVAL -AOFF) / ASLO -
         ROFF.

   3. Check alarms: This routine checks to see if the new VAL causes the
   alarm status and severity to change. If so, NSEV, NSTA and y are set.
   It also honors the alarm hysteresis factor (HYST). Thus the value
   must change by at least HYST before the alarm status and severity is
   reduced.
   
   4. Check severity and write the new value. See Invalid Alarm Output
   Action for details on how invalid alarms affect output records.
   
   5. If PACT has been changed to TRUE, the device support write output
   routine has started but has not completed writing the new value. In
   this case, the processing routine merely returns, leaving PACT TRUE.
   
   6. Check to see if monitors should be invoked:

   -  Alarm monitors are invoked if the alarm status or severity has
      changed.
   -  Archive and value change monitors are invoked if ADEL and MDEL
      conditions are met.
   -  Monitors for RVAL and for RBV are checked whenever other monitors
      are invoked.
   -  NSEV and NSTA are reset to 0.

   7. Scan forward link if necessary, set PACT and INIT FALSE, and
   return.

Device Support

Fields Of Interest To Device Support
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Each analog output record must have an associated set of device
   support routines. The primary responsibility of the device support
   routines is to output a new value whenever write_ao is called. The
   device support routines are primarily interested in the following
   fields:

   -  PACT — Process Active, used to indicate asynchronous completion
   -  DPVT — Device Private, reserved for device support to use
   -  OUT — Output Link, provides addressing information
   -  EGUF — Engineering Units Full
   -  EGUL — Engineering Units Low
   -  ESLO — Engineering Unit Slope
   -  EOFF — Engineering Unit Offset
   -  OVAL — Output Value, in Engineering units
   -  RVAL — Raw Output Value, after conversion

Device Support routines
+++++++++++++++++++++++

   Device support consists of the following routines:

   report
      ``long report(int level);``

      This optional routine is called by the IOC command ``dbior`` and
      is passed the report level that was requested by the user. It
      should print a report on the state of the device support to
      stdout. The ``level`` parameter may be used to output increasingly
      more detailed information at higher levels, or to select different
      types of information with different levels. Level zero should
      print no more than a small summary.

   init
      ``long init(int after);``

      This optional routine is called twice at IOC initialization time.
      The first call happens before any of the ``init_record()`` calls
      are made, with the integer parameter ``after`` set to 0. The
      second call happens after all of the ``init_record()`` calls have
      been made, with ``after`` set to 1.

   init_record
      ``long init_record(aoRecord *prec);``

      This optional routine is called by the record initialization code
      for each ao record instance that has its DTYP field set to use
      this device support. It is normally used to check that the OUT
      address has the expected type and points to a valid device; to
      allocate any record-specific buffer space and other memory; and to
      connect any communication channels needed for the ``write_ao()``
      routine to work properly.

      If the record type's unit conversion features are used, the
      ``init_record()`` routine should calculate appropriate values for
      the ESLO and EOFF fields from the EGUL and EGUF field values. This
      calculation only has to be performed if the record's LINR field is
      set to ``LINEAR``, but it is not necessary to check that condition
      first. This same calculation takes place in the
      ``special_linconv()`` routine, so the implementation can usually
      just call that routine to perform the task.

      If the the last output value can be read back from the hardware,
      this routine should also fetch that value and put it into the
      record's RVAL or VAL field. The return value should be zero if the
      RVAL field has been set, or 2 if either the VAL field has been set
      or if the last output value cannot be retrieved.

   get_ioint_info
      ``long get_ioint_info(int cmd, aoRecord *prec, IOSCANPVT *piosl);``

      This optional routine is called whenever the record's SCAN field
      is being changed to or from the value ``I/O Intr`` to find out
      which I/O Interrupt Scan list the record should be added to or
      deleted from. If this routine is not provided, it will not be
      possible to set the SCAN field to the value ``I/O Intr`` at all.

      The ``cmd`` parameter is zero when the record is being added to
      the scan list, and one when it is being removed from the list. The
      routine must determine which interrupt source the record should be
      connected to, which it indicates by the scan list that it points
      the location at ``*piosl`` to before returning. It can prevent the
      SCAN field from being changed at all by returning a non-zero value
      to its caller.

      In most cases the device support will create the I/O Interrupt
      Scan lists that it returns for itself, by calling
      ``void scanIoInit(IOSCANPVT *piosl)`` once for each separate
      interrupt source. That API allocates memory and inializes the
      list, then passes back a pointer to the new list in the location
      at ``*piosl``. When the device support receives notification that
      the interrupt has occurred, it announces that to the IOC by
      calling ``void scanIoRequest(IOSCANPVT iosl)`` which will arrange
      for the appropriate records to be processed in a suitable thread.
      The ``scanIoRequest()`` routine is safe to call from an interrupt
      service routine on embedded architectures (vxWorks and RTEMS).

   write_ao
      ``long write_ao(aoRecord *prec);``

      This essential routine is called whenever the record has a new
      output value to send to the device. It is responsible for
      performing the write operation, using either the engineering units
      value found in the record's OVAL field, or the raw value from the
      record's RVAL field if the record type's unit conversion
      facilities are used. A return value of zero indicates success, any
      other value indicates that an error occurred.

      This routine must not block (busy-wait) if the device takes more
      than a few microseconds to accept the new value. In that case the
      routine must use asynchronous completion to tell the record when
      the write operation eventually completes. It signals that this is
      an asynchronous operation by setting the record's PACT field to
      TRUE before it returns, having arranged for the record's
      ``process()`` routine to be called later once the write operation
      is over. When that happens the ``write_ao()`` routine will be
      called again with PACT still set to TRUE; it should then set it to
      FALSE to indicate the write has completed, and return.

   special_linconv
      ``long special_linconv(aoRecord *prec, int after);``

      This optional routine should be provided if the record type's unit
      conversion features are used by the device support's
      ``write_ao()`` routine utilizing the RVAL field rather than OVAL
      or VAL. It is called by the record code whenever any of the the
      fields LINR, EGUL or EGUF are modified and LINR has the value
      ``LINEAR``. The routine must calculate and set the fields EOFF and
      ESLO appropriately based on the new values of EGUL and EGUF.

      These calculations can be expressed in terms of the minimum and
      maximum raw values that the ``write_ao()`` routine can accept in
      the RVAL field. When VAL is EGUF the RVAL field will be set to
      *RVAL_max*, and when VAL is EGUL the RVAL field will become
      *RVAL_min*. The fomulae to use are:

         EOFF = (*RVAL_max* \* EGUL − *RVAL_min* \* EGUF) / (*RVAL_max*
         − *RVAL_min*)

         ESLO = (EGUF − EGUL) / (*RVAL_max* − *RVAL_min*)

      Note that the record support sets EOFF to EGUL before calling this
      routine, which is a very common case (*RVAL_min* is zero).

Device Support For Soft Records
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Two soft device support modules Soft Channel and Raw Soft Channel are
   provided for output records not related to actual hardware devices.
   The OUT link type must be either a CONSTANT, DB_LINK, or CA_LINK.

Soft Channel
++++++++++++

   This module writes the current value of OVAL.

   If the OUT link type is PV_LINK, then dbCaAddInlink is called by
   ``init_record()``. ``init_record()`` always returns a value of 2,
   which means that no conversion will ever be attempted.

   write_ao calls recGblPutLinkValue to write the current value of VAL.
   See Soft Output for details.

Raw Soft Channel
++++++++++++++++

   This module is like the previous except that it writes the current
   value of RVAL.
