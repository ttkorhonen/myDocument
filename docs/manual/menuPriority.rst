Processing priority
===================

.. container:: pod

   .. rubric:: Menu menuPriority
      :name: menu-menupriority

   This menu is used for the ``PRIO`` field of all record types. It
   controls the relative priority of records scheduled with
   ``SCAN=Event`` or ``SCAN=I/O Intr``, and also of records that use
   asynchronous completion.

      ===== ================== =============
      Index Identifier         Choice String
      ===== ================== =============
      0     menuPriorityLOW    LOW
      1     menuPriorityMEDIUM MEDIUM
      2     menuPriorityHIGH   HIGH
      ===== ================== =============

   The number of priorities is set in various other places in the code
   too, so adding new entries to this menu will probably break the IOC
   build.
