      :name: menu-menuyesno

   This menu is used by many record types to specify simple ``NO`` or
   ``YES`` options for record-specific purposes.

   Note that no other values for a field that uses menuYesNo are
   possible, e.g. ``MAYBE`` or ``NO WAY`` would not be accepted as
   choices for the field. Also, the choices ``yes``, ``No``, and ``Yes``
   are not valid choices since they don't match the case of ``NO`` or
   ``YES``. The integer values ``0`` and ``1`` may often be used instead
   however, they are used as an index into the choices so ``0`` becomes
   ``NO`` and ``1`` becomes ``YES``.
